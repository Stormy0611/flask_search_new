The aim of this study was to evaluate the  demographic characteristics, response to treatments, and outcomes of a cohort of  patients who developed immune cytopenias following SOT. PROCEDURE: In this single  center retrospective review, patients with immune cytopenias after SOT were  identified by electronic medical record (EMR) search and transplant databases from  1995-2012. RESULTS: Of 764 SOT patients, 19 (2.4%) developed immune cytopenias.  Incidence varied widely by transplant type from 1.2% (rel) to 23.5%  (multivisceral). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) was the most common immune  cytopenia.

However, among women ≤24 years old who had delivered an infant in  the prior 8 weeks, a LNG-IUS was more likely to be inserted than an ENG implant (P <  .05). The most frequent complications with both methods were related to abnormal  menstruation, which was more likely to occur among ENG implant users.

Of these, 1,782 (90%) were  methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA), and 204 (10%) were methicillin-resistant S  aureus (MRSA). The most common specimen type from which MSSA was isolated was an  oral rinse, whereas for MRSA this was a tongue swab. Most of the MRSA isolates were  EMRSA-15 or EMRSA-16 lineage. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that S aureus  continues to be a frequent isolate in the oral cavity and perioral region. The oral  cavity should be considered a source of S aureus in terms of cross-infection and  dissemition to other body sites. The role of S aureus in the pathogenesis of  certain oral diseases should also be considered as part of a differential diagnosis.']",['Staphylococcus aureus and the oral cavity: an overlooked source of carriage and infection?

However, few specific recommendations on  second-line agents are provided. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to  describe antidiabetic treatment patterns in Medicare Advantage patients with T2DM  within 6 months of measurement of the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level.  RESEARCH DESIGN: This retrospective cross-sectiol study utilized medical,  pharmacy, and laboratory claims from a large Medicare Advantage with Prescription  Drug (MAPD) coverage payer. MAPD members between 65 and 89 years old identified as  having T2DM between 2009 and 2011 were eligible for inclusion. A 12-month baseline  period before the first HbA1c value (index date) was evaluated for demographic and  clinical differences. Antidiabetic therapy was evaluated for 6 months post-index.  The study population was stratified into three cohorts based on index HbA1c value:  controlled (<8%, 64 mmoL/mol), uncontrolled (≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol and <10%, 86  mmoL/mol), and severely uncontrolled (≥ 10%, 86 mmoL/mol). RESULTS: Despite elevated  HbA1c values (≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol), 7-8% of patients did not receive antidiabetic  therapy during the post-index period. Metformin and sulfonylureas were the oral  antidiabetics (OADs) most frequently used as monotherapy. The majority of patients  on combition therapy were on two or more OADs and higher injectable use was  observed in the severely uncontrolled cohort. Metformin was included in >60% of the  combition regimens with metformin + sulfonylurea being the most common.  CONCLUSION: This study suggests suboptimal treatment of those not in glycemic  control (HbA1c ≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol).

The study population was stratified into three cohorts based on index HbA1c value:  controlled (<8%, 64 mmoL/mol), uncontrolled (≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol and <10%, 86  mmoL/mol), and severely uncontrolled (≥ 10%, 86 mmoL/mol). RESULTS: Despite elevated  HbA1c values (≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol), 7-8% of patients did not receive antidiabetic  therapy during the post-index period. Metformin and sulfonylureas were the oral  antidiabetics (OADs) most frequently used as monotherapy. The majority of patients  on combition therapy were on two or more OADs and higher injectable use was  observed in the severely uncontrolled cohort. Metformin was included in >60% of the  combition regimens with metformin + sulfonylurea being the most common.  CONCLUSION: This study suggests suboptimal treatment of those not in glycemic  control (HbA1c ≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol).

Nimodipine has been used in  adults to reduce the incidence of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage  and improve long-term outcomes. There are, however, no data in children. METHODS:  Records of children with a confirmed diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage who  received nimodipine between January 1, 2005 and August 31, 2013 were reviewed.  Dosing of nimodipine and associated hypotensive events were recorded. Transcranial  Doppler ultrasonography, cranial computerized tomography, and angiography were  followed as a measure of cerebral vasospasm, rebleeding, and subsequent infarction.  RESULTS: Twelve children (average age 11.8 ± 3.3 years, age range 3.5 to 17.3 years)  were included. Aneurysm was responsible for the highest percentage (41.7%) of  subarachnoid hemorrhage events. The mean dose of oral nimodipine was 1 mg/kg every 4  hours and was associated with a high rate of hypotension requiring intervention or  dose modification. Clinical outcomes while on nimodipine therapy varied; evidence of  vasospasm was observed in 67%, new infarction in 33%, and rebleeding in 17%.

METHODS: New users of  antidiabetic agents were identified with a 1-year washout period between January 1,  1995, and December 31, 2005, in Saskatchewan, Cada, and were followed until  December 31, 2008. Within this population-based cohort, persons were classified as  users of benefit or non-benefit thiazolidinediones (TZDs) according to their first  prescription record between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2006 (non-benefit  prescription records were not captured before 2006). An intention-to-treat approach  was used to categorize TZD exposure over time. We evaluated the potential bias  introduced by drug exposure misclassification by evaluating bootstrapped differences  in hazard ratio (HR) estimates of all-cause hospitalization or death between users  and nonusers of TZDs obtained from alyses that contained complete drug use  (non-benefit and benefit drug use) versus benefit drug use only (non-benefit drug  use was misclassified as unexposed). All alyses were replicated within the same  cohort of new users of antidiabetic agents for clopidogrel and β-blocker (bisoprolol  or carvedilol) users versus nonusers because these agents were also subject to  exposure misclassification from non-benefit drug use during the period of the study.  FINDINGS: Among 27,333 new users of antidiabetic agents, we identified 5759 TZD  users (28% non-benefit) and 21,574 nonusers of TZDs.

One-year persistence rate in patients taking simvastatin and ezetimibe as a free  combition was 10.97%, whereas it was 24.35% in those on the fixed combition and  30.47% in those on rosuvastatin monotherapy. The hazard ratio of discontinuation of  simvastatin and ezetimibe free combition was 1.73 [95% confidence interval:  1.61-1.85], p<0.0001 compared to fixed combition and 0.80 [95% confidence  interval: 0.78-0.82], p<0.0001 compared to rosuvastatin.

Adequate patient adherence is important to decrease the cardiovascular  risk. AIM: The aim of the authors was to evaluate the persistence on one-year  treatment with the free or fixed combition of simvastatin and ezetimibe and  rosuvastatin. METHOD: Information from the tiol Health Insurance Found  prescriptions database on pharmacy-claims between October 1, 2012 and September 30,  2013 was alyzed. The authors identified patients who filled prescriptions for  fixed or free combitions of simvastatin and ezetimibe and rosuvastatin prescribed  for the first time. The subjects have not received antilipemic therapy with similar  drugs during the year preceding the study. Using Kaplan-Meier technique, the authors  constructed persistence curves with a 95% confidence interval for point estimates  calculated on a log scale. Patients who were still persistent at the closing date of  the study were considered censored. For the modelling of the curves, the authors  used semi-parametric Cox's regression where antihypertensive therapy was the only  (categorical) explatory variable, and the patients taking the fixed combition of  simvastatin and ezetimibe were regarded as the reference group. RESULTS: 204,699  patients met the inclusion criteria. During the study period, antilipemic therapy  with simvastatin and ezetimibe free combition 10,030 and 7,613 fixed combition  of these agents and 187,056 patients with rosuvastatin was started by patients.  One-year persistence rate in patients taking simvastatin and ezetimibe as a free  combition was 10.97%, whereas it was 24.35% in those on the fixed combition and  30.47% in those on rosuvastatin monotherapy. The hazard ratio of discontinuation of  simvastatin and ezetimibe free combition was 1.73 [95% confidence interval:  1.61-1.85], p<0.0001 compared to fixed combition and 0.80 [95% confidence  interval: 0.78-0.82], p<0.0001 compared to rosuvastatin.

Methadone hydrochloride may  increase the risk for lethal respiratory depression related to accidental overdose  and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of  out-of-hospital death in patients receiving methadone for noncancer pain with that  in comparable patients receiving sustained-release (SR) morphine sulfate. DESIGN,  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using  Tennessee Medicaid records from 1997 through 2009. The cohort included patients  receiving morphine SR or methadone who were aged 30 to 74 years, did not have cancer  or another life-threatening illness, and were not in a hospital or nursing home. At  cohort entry, 32u2009742 and 6014 patients had filled a prescription for morphine SR or  methadone, respectively. The patients' median age was 48 years, 57.9% were female,  and comparable proportions had received cardiovascular, psychotropic, and other  musculoskeletal medications. Nearly 90% of the patients received the opioid for back  pain or other musculoskeletal pain. The median doses prescribed for morphine SR and  methadone were 90 mg/d and 40 mg/d, respectively.

We aimed to determine the frequency of metformin use and its  associations among kidney transplant recipients, and to assess allograft and patient  survival associated with metformin use. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study,  we linked Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data for all incident kidney  transplants 2001-2012 and tiol pharmacy claims (n = 46,914). We compared  recipients having one or more pharmacy claims for a metformin-containing product (n  = 4,609) and recipients having one or more claims for a non-metformin  glucose-lowering agent (n = 42,305). RESULTS: On average, metformin claims were  filled later after transplant and were associated with higher estimated glomerular  filtration rates before the first claim.

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol and febuxostat are  recommended to reduce uric acid levels and to prevent gout attacks in adult  patients. Under budget-driven constraints, health care payers are faced with the  broader challenge of assessing the economic value of these agents for formulary  placement. However, the economic value of allopurinol versus febuxostat has not be  assessed in patients with gout over a 5-year time period in the United States.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of allopurinol versus febuxostat in  adult patients with gout over a 5-year time period from a U.S. health care payer's  perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the total direct costs  and success of serum uric acid (sUA) level reduction associated with allopurinol and  febuxostat. Treatment success was defined as patient achievement of a sUA level less  than u20096 mg/dL (0.36 mmol/L) at 6 months. Event probabilities were based on published  phase III randomized clinical trials and included long-term sequelae from open-label  extension studies. A hypothetical cohort of 1,000 adult gout patients with sUA  levels of ≥u20098 mg/dL (0.48 mmol/L) who had received either allopurinol 300 mg or  febuxostat 80 mg at model entry transitioned among the 4 health states defined by  treatment success, treatment failure and switch, treatment dropout, and death. The  length of each Markov cycle was 6 months. Costs were gathered from the RED BOOK,  Medicare fee schedules, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's tionwide  Inpatient Sample, and for a limited number of inputs, expert consultation. Direct  costs included treatment drug costs, costs for prophylaxis drugs, diagnostic  laboratory tests, and the treatment and magement of acute gout flare. Resource  utilization was based on clinical evidence and expert consultation. All costs were  inflated to 2014 U.S. dollars and were discounted at 3% in the base case. One-way  sensitivity alysis and probabilistic sensitivity alyses (PSAs) were performed to  assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The total per patient cost incurred  over 5 years was $50,295 for febuxostat and $48,413 for allopurinol, with an  incremental total cost of $1,882. The expected percentage of treatment success  during the 5-year period was 72 for febuxostat and 42 for allopurinol, resulting in  an incremental percentage of treatment success of 30. The estimated incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio for febuxostat compared with allopurinol was $6,322 per  treatment success over a 5-year time period. The one-way sensitivity alysis  indicated that the results were sensitive to probability of treatment success for  allopurinol, probability of treatment dropouts for both allopurinol and febuxostat,  and the probability of failure and switch to allopurinol.

RESULTS: The total per patient cost incurred  over 5 years was $50,295 for febuxostat and $48,413 for allopurinol, with an  incremental total cost of $1,882. The expected percentage of treatment success  during the 5-year period was 72 for febuxostat and 42 for allopurinol, resulting in  an incremental percentage of treatment success of 30. The estimated incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio for febuxostat compared with allopurinol was $6,322 per  treatment success over a 5-year time period. The one-way sensitivity alysis  indicated that the results were sensitive to probability of treatment success for  allopurinol, probability of treatment dropouts for both allopurinol and febuxostat,  and the probability of failure and switch to allopurinol. PSAs demonstrated that at  a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per treatment success, febuxostat was  cost-effective compared with allopurinol. CONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat was found to be a  cost-effective option compared with allopurinol based on a U.S. payer perspective.FAU - Gandhi, Prav KAU - Gandhi PKAD - South College School of Pharmacy, 400 Goodys Ln., Knoxville, TN 37922.  pgandhi@southcollegetn.edu.FAU - Gentry, William MAU - Gentry WMFAU - Ma, QinliAU - Ma Q""]",['Cost-effectiveness alysis of allopurinol versus febuxostat in chronic gout  patients: a U.S. payer perspective'],uric acid,43532213,uric acid,markov model,clinical trial,Drug,Other Drug,1000,United States

METHODS: A retrospective medical record review of 31  inpatients receiving hospice care who received ketamine for depression on a clinical  basis was conducted.

RESULTS: Using the Clinical Global  Impression Scale, ketamine was found to be significantly therapeutically effective  through the first week after ketamine dosing (p < 0.05), with 93% of patients  showing positive results for days 0-3 and 80% for days 4-7 following ketamine  dosing.

METHODS: Using US commercial insurance claims data (covering 2007  to 2009), we conducted a cohort study to examine the comparative effectiveness of  amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin, and pregabalin on health care utilization in  patients with fibromyalgia. We measured patients' medication adherence using the  proportion of days covered (PDC) and estimated multivariable rate ratios (RRs) for  outpatient visits, prescriptions, hospitalization, and emergency department (ED)  visits in propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts. RESULTS: Cohorts of 8,269  amitriptyline, 9,941 duloxetine, and 18,613 gabapentin initiators were compared with  their PS-matched pregabalin initiators. During the baseline 180-day period, patients  had, on average, seven to nine physician visits, including six to eight specialist  visits, and received eight prescription drugs. The mean PDC up to 180xa0days varied  from 38.6% to 67.7%. The number of outpatient visits, prescriptions, and  hospitalizations decreased slightly after initiating one of the study drugs, but the  number of ED visits increased after treatment initiation.

Overall, fibromyalgia treatment had little  impact on reducing health care utilization, but duloxetine initiators had less  health care utilization than those started on pregabalin.FAU - Kim, Seoyoung CAU - Kim SCAD - Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women's Hospital  and Harvard Medical School, 1620 Tremont St, Suite 3030, Boston, MA, 02120, USA.  skim62@partners.org.FAU - Landon, Joan EAU - Landon JEAD - Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Brigham and Women's Hospital  and Harvard Medical School, 1620 Tremont St, Suite 3030, Boston, MA, 02120, USA.  jlandon@partners.org.""]","['Patterns of health care utilization related to initiation of amitriptyline,  duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin in fibromyalgia']",pregabalin,734354,pregabalin,retrospective,claims,Drug,NERVOUS SYSTEM,8269,

Patients receiving orlistat lost, on average, 0.94u2009kgu2009month(-1) (0.93  to 0.95) over the first 4u2009months. Weight gain then occurred, although weight  remained slightly below baseline at 3u2009years. Patients receiving sibutramine lost,  1.28u2009kgu2009month(-1) (1.26 to 1.30) over the first 4u2009months, but by 3u2009years had  exceeded baseline weight. Non-intervention patients had slight increases in weight  throughout the 3u2009year period, with gains ranging between 0.01 and 0.06u2009kgu2009month(-1)  . CONCLUSIONS: Orlistat and sibutramine had early effects on weight loss, not  sustained over 3u2009years. As new treatments for obesity are approved, their  effectiveness should be measured in routine clinical practice, as effectiveness may  be considerably less than seen in randomized trials.']",['The effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions for obesity: weight loss with  orlistat and sibutramine in a United Kingdom population-based cohort'],weight loss,4058570,weight loss,population-based,EMR/EHR,Measurement,,,United Kingdom

The  two leading agents are similar in effectiveness but vary greatly in price-up to  $2,000 per injection for ranibizumab compared to $50 for bevacizumab. We examined  the diffusion of these drugs in fee-for-service Medicare and Veterans Affairs (VA)  systems during 2005-11, in part to assess the impact that differing fincial  incentives had on prescribing. Physicians treating Medicare patients have a direct  fincial incentive to prescribe the more expensive agent (ranibizumab), while VA  physicians do not. Medicare injections of the more expensive ranibizumab peaked in  2007 at 47xa0percent. Beginning in 2009 the less expensive bevacizumab became the  predomint therapy for Medicare patients, accounting for more than 60xa0percent of  injections. For VA patients, the distribution of injections across the two drugs was  relatively equal, particularly from 2009 to 2011.

METHODS: We used US insurance claims data to conduct a cohort  study among gout patients, comparing XOI initiators with non-users with  hyperuricemia defined as serum uric acid level ≥6.8 mg/dL. We calculated incidence  rates of a composite nonfatal cardiovascular outcome that included myocardial  infarction, corory revascularization, stroke, and heart failure.

RESULTS: There were 24,108 PS-matched pairs with a mean age of 51 years and  88% male.

Noncompliance was associated with a 20% higher risk of any fracture (odds ratio:  1.20, 95% CIu2009=u20091.07-1.35), a higher incidence rate ratio (IRR) for inpatient  utilization (IRR: 1.26, 95% CIu2009=u20091.19-1.34) and a lower rate of outpatient  utilization (IRR: 0.97, 95% CIu2009=u20090.95-0.98). Noncompliant patients had 13% higher  medical costs (cost ratio: 1.13, 95% CIu2009=u20091.06-1.21) than compliant patients.  LIMITATIONS: Inclusion in this study required 36 months of continuous healthcare  coverage.

METHODS: This retrospective alysis of a US claims database  identified women initiating an OP medication from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2009.  Patients were ≥55 years and had ≥1 pharmacy claim for a bisphosphote or  non-bisphosphote (raloxifene, calcitonin, teriparatide); the index date was the  first pharmacy claim. There were three study periods: baseline (12 months  pre-index); compliance period (0-12 months post-index); and follow-up period (12-24  months post-index). Medication possession ratio (MPR) was calculated during the  compliance period to differentiate two cohorts: compliant (MPRu2009≥u200980%) and  noncompliant (MPRu2009<u200980%). Outcomes during follow-up were modeled by logistic  regression (presence of fracture), Poisson regression (healthcare utilization  incidence rate) and gamma regression (healthcare costs), all adjusted for patient  demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 685,505 women initiating  OP therapy were identified and 57,913 (8.4%) met the inclusion criteria: only 23,430  (40.5%) were compliant and 34,483 (59.5%) were noncompliant.

RESULTS: A total of 2144 propensity-score matched patients were included in  the early or delayed treatment group (n=1072, in each). Early treatment was  associated with significantly larger decreases in HbA1c (-0.36%; 95% confidence  intervals [CI]: -0.44 to -0.27%; P<0.001) and BMI (-0.46 kg/m(2); 95% CI: -0.64 to  -0.29 kg/m(2); P<0.001) relative to delayed treatment.

MATERIALS  AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with  recurrent EOC and PPC who had been treated with weekly topotecan between November  2008 and May 2012. Topotecan was given at a dose of 2.75-4 mg/m(2) via a 30-minute  intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle until disease  progression or ucceptable toxicity occurred. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were  identified and 24 (75%) of them had received at least two previous regimens of  chemotherapy; the median number of treatment courses was seven. The main toxicities  (Grades 3 and 4) were anemia in seven (21.9%), neutropenia in six (18.8%), and  thrombocytopenia in two patients (6.2%). No deaths were attributable to the therapy.  Overall, seven patients (21.9%) showed a partial response (PR), while seven patients  (21.9%) with stable disease (SD) were observed. Furthermore, we found a favorable  response and toxicity profile in patients who received the lowest dose intensity  (2.75 mg/m(2)). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)  were 3 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-3.2] and 20 months (95% CI  11.1-28.9), respectively.

In this study, we investigate whether medical or surgical  control of reflux is associated with a decreased risk of progression to  dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively collected and  alyzed data from a cohort of Barrett's esophagus patients participating in this  single-center study comprised of all patients diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus at  NorthShore University Health System hospitals and clinics over a 10-year period.  Patients were followed in order to identify those progressing from Barrett's  esophagus to low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and esophageal  adenocarcinoma. We collected information from the patient's electronic medical  records regarding demographic, endoscopic findings, histological findings,  smoking/alcohol history, medication use including proton-pump inhibitors, and  history of bariatric and antireflux surgery. Risk-adjusted modeling was performed  using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: This study included 1,830 total  Barrett's esophagus patients, 102 of which had their Barrett's esophagus progress to  low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or esophageal adenocarcinoma (confirmed  by biopsy) with an annual incidence rate of 1.1%. Mean follow-up period was 5.51  years (10,083 patient-years).

We report on an  investigation of this pericentral retinopathy within a Korean population. DESIGN:  Retrospective, observatiol study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients taking HCQ who were  referred to ophthalmology for screening of HCQ retinopathy. METHODS: The medical  records of patients were reviewed, including spectral domain optical coherence  tomography, fundus autofluorescence, and visual fields. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Frequency of pericentral pattern of HCQ retinopathy and features of progression.  RESULTS: Among 218 patients referred, 9 (4.1%) were diagnosed with toxicity. Of  these, 8 had a predomintly pericentral pattern of retil change, whereas only 1  had the classic parafoveal distribution of retil damage. Progression of  retinopathy was documented in 3 patients followed more than 12 months while taking  HCQ.

Patients with non-resectable  glioblastoma (GBM) generally exhibit a poor prognosis, even after XRT/TMZ. Few data  are available concerning the predictive value of MGMT promoter methylation in this  population. METHODS: This is an observatiol retrospective study in patients with  malignt brain glioma, treated between June 2008 and October 2011 and followed up  until April 2012 at the Neurosurgery-Neurotraumatology Unit of the University  Hospital of Parma and at the Neurosurgery Unit of IRCCS ""ASMN"" of Reggio Emilia,  Italy. The medical records of an overall number of 174 patients with a newly  diagnosed GBM were reviewed. Volumetry alysis of the lesions was performed on pre-  and post-operative neuroimaging by Voxar 3D Ebit AET software. The genetic  characterization was performed on paraffin embedded tissue from all resected  tumours. Isolation of nucleic acids, bisulfite modification of D,  methylation-specific PCR and sequencing alyses were done mainly on fresh tissue  from biopsy withdrawals. Within 3-4 weeks after either biopsy or surgery, patients  were assigned to receive XRT/TMZ→TMZ: treatment included XRT (60 Gy in 30  fractions)/TMZ (daily dose of 75 mg/m(2))/TMZ (150-200mg/m(2) per day for 5 days of  every 28-day cycle). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 55 consecutive patients (23  men, 22 women) fulfilled inclusion criteria consisting of age over 18 years,  supratentorial histologically proven primary malignt glioma, complete  determition of the MGMT methylation status, no prior history of surgery, XRT  and/or chemotherapy, adequate clinical and radiological follow-up no lesser than 6  months. Twenty-three patients underwent neurovigation needle biopsy (B Group) and  thirty-two patients were operated with craniotomy for tumour resection (R Group).  The pre-operative mean age was similar between groups (61.7 ± 10.7 vs 60.3 ± 11.8  years in the B and R groups respectively; p>0.05). The B groups showed a slightly  lower KPS than the R Group (82.1 ± 17.3 vs 90.3 ± 14.1 respectively; p>0.05). The  mean pre-operative volume of the tumour did not differ between groups (46.2 ± 40.2  cm(3) vs 44.1 ± 33.2 cm(3) in the R Group and B Group respectively; p>0.05). The  MGMT promoter was methylated in 12 patients (51.2%) of B Group and in 17 patients  (53.1%) of R Group. XRT/TMZ → TMZ was accomplished in 11 patients (47.8%) of B Group  and in 24 patients (75%) of R Group; in 24/29 methylated patients (82.8%) and in  11/26 unmethylated patients (42.3%). Survival alysis of methylated vs unmethylated  tumours was statistically significant (Log Rank Mantel Cox: 0.019 in B Group and  0.023 in R Group). In B Group the mean overall survival (OS) of methylated patients  was 11.4 months (IC 95% 6.5-16.4) vs 4.8 months (95% IC, 2.6-7.0) of unmethylated  patients. In R Group the mean OS was 21.7 months (95% IC, 16.9-26.6) for methylated  patients and 14.0 months (95% IC, 8.5-19.4) for unmethylated patients. At the  multivariate Cox regression alysis conducted on the total population (55  patients), XRT and TMZ were found to be predictive of OS. In the R Group, KPS, XRT  and TMZ correlated with a better outcome. In the B Group, XRT and MGMT promoter  methylation were favourably related with OS. CONCLUSION: MGMT promoter unmethylation  has a predomint unfavourable impact on clinical outcomes even in the subpopulation  of patients with non-resectable GBM. The unmethylated MGMT promoter status could be  considered the main predictor of poor prognosis in biopsied GBM, due to the greater  probability of patients not having benefits from adjuvant therapies and not being  able to accomplish XRT/TMZ → TMZ. The frameless neurovigation biopsy technique is  safe and effective for predictive evaluation and could help in treatment decision  making.']",['Prognostic value of MGMT promoter status in non-resectable glioblastoma after  adjuvant therapy'],brain neoplasms,373724,brain neoplasms,retrospective,EMR/EHR,Condition,Neoplasm,,Italy

In R Group the mean OS was 21.7 months (95% IC, 16.9-26.6) for methylated  patients and 14.0 months (95% IC, 8.5-19.4) for unmethylated patients. At the  multivariate Cox regression alysis conducted on the total population (55  patients), XRT and TMZ were found to be predictive of OS. In the R Group, KPS, XRT  and TMZ correlated with a better outcome. In the B Group, XRT and MGMT promoter  methylation were favourably related with OS. CONCLUSION: MGMT promoter unmethylation  has a predomint unfavourable impact on clinical outcomes even in the subpopulation  of patients with non-resectable GBM. The unmethylated MGMT promoter status could be  considered the main predictor of poor prognosis in biopsied GBM, due to the greater  probability of patients not having benefits from adjuvant therapies and not being  able to accomplish XRT/TMZ → TMZ.

Few studies have  estimated the association between real-world talizumab persistence behavior and  relapse-related outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To (a) examine the impact of using talizumab  consistently (i.e., persistent) on relapse-related outcomes as compared with  transitioning to inconsistent talizumab use (i.e., nonpersistent) and (b) examine  the impact of other treatment patterns on relapse-related outcomes for those who  initiated talizumab. METHODS: Using the IMS PharMetrics Plus claims database  (years 2006-2012), we identified MS subjects who initiated talizumab (no  talizumab claims in year prior) and had at least 2 years of follow-up. Persistence  in annual follow-up periods was defined as no 90-day or greater gap in talizumab  therapy. Relapse was an MS-related hospitalization or outpatient visit with  intravenous or oral steroid burst claim within 7 days. Alyses compared  observations based on changes in talizumab persistence and talizumab  nonpersistence status from 1 year to the next (e.g., transitioning from persistent  to nonpersistent), estimating differences in mean annual relapses and mean annual  relapse-related costs. RESULTS: A total of 2,407 talizumab initiators had at least  2 years of follow-up, yielding 4,770 year-to-year talizumab treatment patterns  where each subject contributed 1, 2, or 3 year-to-year treatment patterns. In the  year prior, 3,187 treatment patterns were persistent; 731 (22.9%) of these  transitioned to nonpersistence. The remaining 1,583 treatment patterns were  nonpersistent in the year prior; 132 (8.3%) of these transitioned to persistence.  Persistent to nonpersistent treatment patterns were associated with a mean  relapse-rate increase of 0.23 (95% CIu2009=u20090.12, 0.35), and a mean increase in  relapse-related costs of $1,346 (95% CIu2009=u2009$97, $2,595). Nonpersistent to persistent  treatment patterns were associated with a mean relapse-rate decrease of -0.15 (95%  CIu2009=u2009-0.32, 0.017) and a mean decrease in relapse-related costs of -$1,369 (95%  CIu2009=u2009-$2,761, $23). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that real-world persistent  talizumab users who become nonpersistent have statistically significant increases  in annual relapses and relapse-related costs.

METHODS: Using the IMS PharMetrics Plus claims database  (years 2006-2012), we identified MS subjects who initiated talizumab (no  talizumab claims in year prior) and had at least 2 years of follow-up. Persistence  in annual follow-up periods was defined as no 90-day or greater gap in talizumab  therapy. Relapse was an MS-related hospitalization or outpatient visit with  intravenous or oral steroid burst claim within 7 days. Alyses compared  observations based on changes in talizumab persistence and talizumab  nonpersistence status from 1 year to the next (e.g., transitioning from persistent  to nonpersistent), estimating differences in mean annual relapses and mean annual  relapse-related costs. RESULTS: A total of 2,407 talizumab initiators had at least  2 years of follow-up, yielding 4,770 year-to-year talizumab treatment patterns  where each subject contributed 1, 2, or 3 year-to-year treatment patterns.

Persistent to nonpersistent treatment patterns were associated with a mean  relapse-rate increase of 0.23 (95% CIu2009=u20090.12, 0.35), and a mean increase in  relapse-related costs of $1,346 (95% CIu2009=u2009$97, $2,595).

Using  variables selected a priori, multivariable logistic regression models were fit to  the outcome of PICC-DVT, comparing cases to controls. RESULTS: 909 adult  hospitalized patients (268 cases, 641 controls) were included in the study.  Indications for PICC placement included long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy  (n=447; 49.1%), in-hospital venous access for blood draws or infusion of medications  (n=342; 44.2%), and total parenteral nutrition (n=120; 6.7%). Patients with PICC-DVT  were more likely to have a history of venous thromboembolism (OR 1.70, 95%  CI=1.02-2.82) or have undergone surgery while the PICC was in situ (OR 2.17,  95%CI=1.17-4.01 for surgeries longer than two hours). Treatment for PICC-DVT varied  and included heparin bridging, low molecular weight heparin only and device removal  only; the average duration of treatment also varied across these groups. Compared to  4-Fr PICCs, 5- and 6-Fr PICCs were associated with greater risk of DVT (OR 2.74,  95%CI=0.75-10.09 and OR 7.40 95%CI=1.94-28.16, respectively). Patients who received  both aspirin and statins were less likely to develop PICC-DVT than those that  received neither treatment (OR 0.31, 95%CI=0.16-0.61). Receipt of pharmacological  DVT prophylaxis during hospitalization showed a non-significant trend towards  reduction in risk of PICC-DVT (OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.48-1.08). CONCLUSION: Several  factors appear associated with PICC-DVT. While some of these characteristics may be  non-modifiable, future studies that target potentially modifiable variables to  prevent this adverse outcome would be welcomed.']","['Patterns, risk factors and treatment associated with PICC-DVT in hospitalized  adults: A nested case-control study']",catheterization,4164278,catheterization,case-control,EMR/EHR,Procedure,,,

Few studies have examined the effect of postoperative delirium on outcomes  after cardiac surgery. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between delirium after  cardiac surgery and the following outcomes: length of stay after surgery, prevalence  of falls, discharge to a nursing facility, discharge to home with home health  services, and use of inpatient physical therapy.

Pertussis-related morbidity and mortality are highest in young infants. We  investigated risk markers for pertussis and vaccition status in infants. METHODS:  Reported pertussis cases under one year old during 1998-2011 in the Jerusalem  district were matched to controls by birthdate and residence. Data sources included  epidemiological investigations, health records and vaccition records (number and  dates of DTPDTaP doses scheduled at 2, 4, 6 months). Vaccine effectiveness was  calculated by number of vaccine doses stratified by age group. Timeliness of vaccine  doses was also evaluated. RESULTS: The study population included 1268 infants under  1 year: 317 pertussis cases and 951 age-matched controls (mean age 3.95±3, median  2.9 months). Low birthweight (<2500g, 12.3% in cases vs. 6.3% in controls) and high  birth order (4th and above) were found to be independent risk markers. Male gender  and low socio-economic status were more frequent among cases.

One patient with  acetaminophen-induced ALF died (5.6%; 0.06 events/1,000,000 person-years) compared  with 3 patients with non-acetaminophen-induced ALF (21.4%; 0.18/1,000,000  person-years). Overall, 6 patients (18.8%) underwent liver transplantation, and 22  patients (68.8%) were discharged without transplantation. The incidence rates of any  definite drug-induced ALF and acetaminophen-induced ALF were 1.61 events/1,000,000  person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.35) and 1.02 events/1,000,000  person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.63), respectively. CONCLUSIONS:  Drug-induced ALF is uncommon, but over-the-counter products and dietary/herbal  supplements are its most common causes.']",['Population-representative incidence of drug-induced acute liver failure based on an  alysis of an integrated health care system'],liver failure,4245975,liver failure,population-based,EMR/EHR,Condition,Digestive disease,,United States

In this setting, patients with stroke mimic (SM) may mistakenly receive  intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-rtPA). The goal of this study was to  investigate the excess direct/indirect hospital costs among patients who received  IV-rtPA when fil diagnosis was not ischemic stroke. METHODS: We reviewed the  records of 535 IV-rtPA-treated patients who presented to our primary stroke centers.  The diagnosis of SM or transient ischemic attack (TIA) was based on patient  presentation, hospital course, electroencephalography, and negative neuroimaging  studies.

RESULTS: The study included 78 patients with a median follow-up  of 46 months; 85% of the patients had stage II disease (32% with bulky disease).  Four of 77 interim PET scans were positive; none of these patients relapsed during  follow-up, which ranged from 24 to 80 months.

However, to date,  there are no published long-term clinical data on the cost-effectiveness of  trabeculectomy with mitomycin vs tube insertion. OBJECTIVE: To assess the  cost-effectiveness of these procedures compared with maximal medical treatment.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the Markov cohort model with a 5-year  time horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 patients who required  glaucoma surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)  gained, costs from the societal perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio of medical treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion. Costs were  identified from Medicare Current Procedural Terminology and Ambulatory Payment  Classification reimbursement codes and Red Book medication costs. The QALYs were  based on visual field and visual acuity outcomes. The hypothetical societal limit to  resources was included using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY.  Costs and utilities were discounted at 3% per year. Uncertainty was assessed using  deterministic sensitivity alyses. RESULTS: The mean costs for medical treatment,  trabeculectomy, and tube insertion were $6172, $7872 and $10 075, respectively;  these amounts resulted in a cost difference of $1700 (95% CI, $1644-$1770) for  medical treatment vs trabeculectomy, $3904 (95% CI, $3858-$3953) for medical  treatment vs tube insertion, and $2203 (95% CI, $2121-$2261) for trabeculectomy vs  tube insertion. The mean 5-year probability of blindness was 4% for both surgical  procedures and 15% for medical treatment. The utility gained after medical  treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion was 3.10, 3.30, and 3.38 QALYs,  respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $8289 per QALY for  trabeculectomy vs medical treatment, $13 896 per QALY for tube insertion vs medical  treatment, and $29 055 per QALY for tube insertion vs trabeculectomy. The  cost-effectiveness of each surgical procedure was most sensitive to early and late  surgical failure rates and was minimally affected by adverse events, rates of visual  field progression, or medication costs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assuming a  willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY, trabeculectomy and tube insertion are  cost-effective compared with medical treatment alone.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the Markov cohort model with a 5-year  time horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 patients who required  glaucoma surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)  gained, costs from the societal perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio of medical treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion. Costs were  identified from Medicare Current Procedural Terminology and Ambulatory Payment  Classification reimbursement codes and Red Book medication costs. The QALYs were  based on visual field and visual acuity outcomes. The hypothetical societal limit to  resources was included using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY.

RESULTS: The mean costs for medical treatment,  trabeculectomy, and tube insertion were $6172, $7872 and $10 075, respectively;  these amounts resulted in a cost difference of $1700 (95% CI, $1644-$1770) for  medical treatment vs trabeculectomy, $3904 (95% CI, $3858-$3953) for medical  treatment vs tube insertion, and $2203 (95% CI, $2121-$2261) for trabeculectomy vs  tube insertion. The mean 5-year probability of blindness was 4% for both surgical  procedures and 15% for medical treatment. The utility gained after medical  treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion was 3.10, 3.30, and 3.38 QALYs,  respectively.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective/prospective cohort study of 789  heroin-using adults in a catchment area, collecting data on their usage of medical  care, including inpatient care, emergency visits, and outpatient care, in a 2-year  observation period. We interviewed and reviewed the medical records of 789 heroin  users in a methadone clinic of a general hospital in a rural area of Taiwan. The  demographic data, records of service use, diagnoses, and information on viral  infection status from Jan. 1, 2007 to Dec. 31, 2008 were collected. Most patients  were middle-aged and unemployed, had a basic educatiol level, and began their  first heroin use in their twenties. RESULTS: The health service utilization of  heroin users was mostly for infectious diseases, orthopedic conditions, and  gastroenterological disorders mainly due to blood-borne or local infections and  traumatic injury. Heroin users utilize fewer outpatient or inpatient services, but  more emergency care than the general public.

Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from  Cox proportiol-hazards models. RESULTS: In males aged 30-39 years, a BMI of  25.0-27.5 was associated with a 2.21 higher risk of ischemic heart disease (95%CI:  1.01-4.84) than those not overweight (BMI of <25.0); LDL of 160 mg/dl or more was  associated with a 3.85 higher risk (95%CI:1.62-9.14) than LDL of less than 120  mg/dl; and FPG of 160 mg/dl or more was associated with a 6.43 higher risk (95%CI:  1.02-40.63) than a FPG of less than 110 mg/dl. For males aged 40-55 years, higher  LDL was a risk factor of ischemic heart disease (1.95 (95%CI: 1.28-2.98) and 1.97  (95%CI: 1.34-2.90) for LDL of more than 160 mg/dl and 140-159 mg/dl, respectively),  compared to those with LDL of less than 120 mg/dl. In the same age group, compared  to those uffected, the risk of ischemic heart disease was 1.94 times higher  (95%CI: 1.27-2.97) and 1.61 times higher (95%CI: 1.08-2.40) for those treated for  hypertension and hyperlipidemia, respectively. Furthermore, compared to non-smokers,  those smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day had 3.12 higher risk (95%CI: 1.21-8.06)  and 1.81 higher risk (95%CI: 1.25-2.62) of ischemic heart disease in the 30-39 and  40-55 years age groups, respectively. Interaction effects with age group were not  significant. DISCUSSION: In males aged 30-39 years having a high BMI, LDL, FPG, and  smoking more than 20 cigarettes increased the risk of ischemic heart disease. For  males aged 40-55 years taking medication for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  increased the risk. To prevent ischemic heart disease during the prime of life,  offering support for weight control and stopping smoking is necessary in younger age  groups.

In the same age group, compared  to those uffected, the risk of ischemic heart disease was 1.94 times higher  (95%CI: 1.27-2.97) and 1.61 times higher (95%CI: 1.08-2.40) for those treated for  hypertension and hyperlipidemia, respectively. Furthermore, compared to non-smokers,  those smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day had 3.12 higher risk (95%CI: 1.21-8.06)  and 1.81 higher risk (95%CI: 1.25-2.62) of ischemic heart disease in the 30-39 and  40-55 years age groups, respectively. Interaction effects with age group were not  significant. DISCUSSION: In males aged 30-39 years having a high BMI, LDL, FPG, and  smoking more than 20 cigarettes increased the risk of ischemic heart disease. For  males aged 40-55 years taking medication for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  increased the risk. To prevent ischemic heart disease during the prime of life,  offering support for weight control and stopping smoking is necessary in younger age  groups. Moreover, implementing a long-term risk magement plan to prevent the onset  of hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia is also important.FAU - Hataka, YokoAU - Hataka YAD - DENSO Health Insurance Society, 2-41 Shintomichou, Kariya, Aichi 448-0045, Japan.FAU - Tamakoshi, AkikoAU - Tamakoshi A']",['[Risk factors for ischemic heart disease in males in the prime of life: An  eight-year follow-up study]'],risk magement,4024608,risk magement,retrospective,claims,Procedure,,,Japan

Providence Cancer Center,  like other institutions, deferred the venous administration method to clinical  judgment incorporating patient preference. Patient experience was evaluated for  oxaliplatin-related local reactions by peripheral or central venous administration.  METHODS: A retrospective review of the electronic medical record was performed of  the period of January 2011 to March 2013 to identify patients who received  oxaliplatin. Included were 59 patients who were given the option of either  peripheral or central venous drug administration. The two patient groups (peripheral  vein vs. central vein administration) were compared in terms of frequency and type  of local reactions (redness/discoloration, swelling, numbness/cold, or  pain/discomfort). RESULTS: Nineteen (63.3%) of the patients in the peripheral vein  group experienced some type of local reaction compared to none in the central vein  group (pu2009<u2009.0001). Pain was the most common local reaction, occurring in 17 (56.7%)  patients in the peripheral group. Despite the occurrence of a local reaction, the  majority of patients did not alter their initial choice of infusion method.  CONCLUSION: This is the first published report to characterize and quantify a single  institution's experience with oxaliplatin-related local reactions.

Providence Cancer Center,  like other institutions, deferred the venous administration method to clinical  judgment incorporating patient preference. Patient experience was evaluated for  oxaliplatin-related local reactions by peripheral or central venous administration.  METHODS: A retrospective review of the electronic medical record was performed of  the period of January 2011 to March 2013 to identify patients who received  oxaliplatin. Included were 59 patients who were given the option of either  peripheral or central venous drug administration. The two patient groups (peripheral  vein vs. central vein administration) were compared in terms of frequency and type  of local reactions (redness/discoloration, swelling, numbness/cold, or  pain/discomfort). RESULTS: Nineteen (63.3%) of the patients in the peripheral vein  group experienced some type of local reaction compared to none in the central vein  group (pu2009<u2009.0001). Pain was the most common local reaction, occurring in 17 (56.7%)  patients in the peripheral group.

MCMs were a code for any major congenital malformation dated within 30 days of the  delivery date on the mother's claims or within 365 days after infant birth date,  excluding a genetic or syndromic basis, and with procedure or healthcare usage  consistent with the MCM diagnosis code in the 365 days after infant birth. RESULTS:  Of the 10 specific common MCMs evaluated, 1 (conotruncal heart defects) had a  prevalence ratio greater than 1.5 for both primary comparisons, and 4 (ventricular  septal defect, atrial septal defect, hypospadias, coarctation of the aorta) had a  prevalence ratio greater than 1.5 for one of the two comparisons. Following  screening of organ systems with elevated MCMs, the prevalence ratio was greater than  1.5 for patent ductus arteriosus in both comparisons and for obstructive  genitouriry defects in one comparison.

RESULTS:  Of the 10 specific common MCMs evaluated, 1 (conotruncal heart defects) had a  prevalence ratio greater than 1.5 for both primary comparisons, and 4 (ventricular  septal defect, atrial septal defect, hypospadias, coarctation of the aorta) had a  prevalence ratio greater than 1.5 for one of the two comparisons.

We  therefore studied what proportion of ischemic strokes in patients with atrial  fibrillation early after CABG surgery were potentially preventable by  anticoagulation with warfarin. METHODS: We reviewed medical records from 2264  patients with isolated CABG performed during a period when our institution had no  policy on anticoagulation for postoperative atrial fibrillation. The outcome was  ischemic stroke within 30days postoperatively and verified with computed tomography  (CT) in patients with new postoperative atrial fibrillation for more than 48h.  RESULTS: New, postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 403 (17.8%) of the  patients and 191 of those (47.4%) were not started on warfarin at 48hours. Eight  patients developed CT-verified ischemic stroke, which occurred on postoperative day  1-3 in 4 patients and in 3 patients was of the lacur type. In two patients (stroke  day 25 and day 30) warfarin could have been preventive. In another patient with  onset of neurological symptoms on postoperative day 8 (4days from onset of the  arrhythmia), systemic anticoagulation might have limited the severity of the stroke  but warfarin therapy would not likely have reached therapeutic levels within 2days.  CONCLUSION: The preventive effect of warfarin on early stroke associated with new  atrial fibrillation after CABG seems limited. Treatment with warfarin during the  hospitalization has to take the risk of bleeding, particularly into the pericardium,  as reported in the literature, into account.']",['Anticoagulation for stroke prevention in new atrial fibrillation after corory  artery bypass graft surgery'],tomography,4161190,tomography,retrospective,EMR/EHR,Procedure,,,

RESULTS: New, postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 403 (17.8%) of the  patients and 191 of those (47.4%) were not started on warfarin at 48hours. Eight  patients developed CT-verified ischemic stroke, which occurred on postoperative day  1-3 in 4 patients and in 3 patients was of the lacur type. In two patients (stroke  day 25 and day 30) warfarin could have been preventive. In another patient with  onset of neurological symptoms on postoperative day 8 (4days from onset of the  arrhythmia), systemic anticoagulation might have limited the severity of the stroke  but warfarin therapy would not likely have reached therapeutic levels within 2days.  CONCLUSION: The preventive effect of warfarin on early stroke associated with new  atrial fibrillation after CABG seems limited.

This study aimed to assess, among patients with NVAF,  the effect of rivaroxaban versus warfarin on health care costs in a cohort of  rivaroxaban users and matched warfarin users. METHODS: Health care claims from the  Huma database from 5/2011 to 12/2012 were alyzed. Adult patients newly initiated  on rivaroxaban or warfarin with ≥2 atrial fibrillation (AF) diagnoses (The  Intertiol Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification:  427.31) and without valvular AF were identified. Based on propensity score methods,  warfarin patients were matched 1:1 to rivaroxaban patients.

Although estimated mean costs of ER visits were higher for rivaroxaban  users compared to those of warfarin users, differences were not statistically  significant. Including anticoagulant costs, mean overall total all-cause costs were  comparable for rivaroxaban versus warfarin users due to cost offset from a reduction  in the number and length of hospitalizations and number of outpatient visits  ($17,590 vs. $18,676, P = 0.542).

This US claims alysis evaluated, from  a US health plan perspective, patterns of total direct costs of care from treatment  initiation to progression for patients with MM treated with novel agents, using time  to next therapy (TTNT) as a proxy measure for progression. METHODS: A retrospective  study was conducted using a large US claims database, evaluating patients with  claims for MM between 2006 and 2013.

The alysis focused on patients receiving lelidomide (LEN)  or bortezomib (BORT) based treatment, for whom complete claim history was available  through initiation of subsequent treatment.

RESULTS: The study population comprised 2843  patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) and 1361 with relapsed MM. Total monthly  cost for patients with NDMM declined steadily, from $15,734 initially to $5082 at  18+ months after therapy. Upon initiation of second-line therapy, total monthly  costs rose to $13,876 and declined to $6446 18 months later.

METHODS: Potential participants were  recruited for TOP MS by specialty pharmacies who dispensed glatiramer acetate and  beta interferons for MS tionwide. Signed IRB-approved informed consents were  returned to the pharmacies. TOP MS used electronic data capture with monthly patient  entries. Adherence, measured by medication possession ratio (MPR), was derived from  pharmacy shipment records. Logistic regression examined the association between  protocol-defined relapses and DMT MPR (<0.5; >0.5-<0.9; >0.9). RESULTS: TOP MS  enrolled 3151 persons with MS, and 2410 completed the full 2 years. Across all  therapies, the mean MPR for the 2-year completer cohort of 2049 who maintained the  same DMT was 0.9+0.2 (range: 0.1-1.0), with 63.8% reaching a 2-year MPR >0.9.  Evaluated by categories of MPR, the proportion of participants remaining  relapse-free for 24 months increased with increasing MPR, and the proportion with >1  relapses declined with increasing levels of MPR (p<0.0008). Regression alysis  revealed the odds of relapse for a patient in the MPR >0.9 MPR group was 64% that of  a patient in the MPR <0.5 category (p=0.02). Use of >1 DMT prior to the current one  was an independent predictor of relapse.

METHODS: Potential participants were  recruited for TOP MS by specialty pharmacies who dispensed glatiramer acetate and  beta interferons for MS tionwide. Signed IRB-approved informed consents were  returned to the pharmacies. TOP MS used electronic data capture with monthly patient  entries. Adherence, measured by medication possession ratio (MPR), was derived from  pharmacy shipment records. Logistic regression examined the association between  protocol-defined relapses and DMT MPR (<0.5; >0.5-<0.9; >0.9). RESULTS: TOP MS  enrolled 3151 persons with MS, and 2410 completed the full 2 years. Across all  therapies, the mean MPR for the 2-year completer cohort of 2049 who maintained the  same DMT was 0.9+0.2 (range: 0.1-1.0), with 63.8% reaching a 2-year MPR >0.9.  Evaluated by categories of MPR, the proportion of participants remaining  relapse-free for 24 months increased with increasing MPR, and the proportion with >1  relapses declined with increasing levels of MPR (p<0.0008). Regression alysis  revealed the odds of relapse for a patient in the MPR >0.9 MPR group was 64% that of  a patient in the MPR <0.5 category (p=0.02). Use of >1 DMT prior to the current one  was an independent predictor of relapse.

This study compared the risk of ischemic stroke in elderly  patients taking CAPs and AAPs. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of  71,584 elderly patients who were newly prescribed the CAPs (haloperidol or  chlorpromazine) and those prescribed the AAPs (risperidone, quetiapine, or  olanzapine). We used the tiol Claims Database from the Health Insurance Review  and Assessment Service (HIRA) from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2009. Incident  cases for ischemic stroke (ICD-10, I63) were identified. The hazard ratios (HR) for  AAPs, CAPs, and for each antipsychotic were calculated using multivariable Cox  regression models, with risperidone as a reference. RESULTS: Among a total of 71,584  patients, 24,668 patients were on risperidone, 15,860 patients on quetiapine, 3,888  patients on olanzapine, 19,564 patients on haloperidol, and 7,604 patients on  chlorpromazine.

The objective of this study was to compare the rate of hospitalization in  patients treated with rivaroxaban after its introduction with what it would have  been before the introduction of rivaroxaban. METHODS: A retrospective claims  alysis was conducted using the MarketScan Hospital Drug Database from January 2011  to December 2013. Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis  (DVT) treated with rivaroxaban or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridged to  warfarin during the first day of an evaluation at a hospital were identified. Based  on propensity-score methods, historical LMWH/warfarin patients (i.e., patients who  received LMWH/warfarin before the approval of rivaroxaban) were matched 4:1 to  rivaroxaban patients, and the rates of hospitalization were compared. RESULTS: All  rivaroxaban-treated patients (n = 134) in the database were well matched with four  historical LMWH/warfarin-treated patients (n = 536). Among the rivaroxaban cohort,  60% of the patients were admitted to the hospital, compared to 82% of the historical  patients treated with LMWH/warfarin in the matched cohort. The difference was  statistically significant and corresponded to a 27% reduction in hospital admissions  (rate ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.73 [0.62-0.84]).

The recent addition of 2 direct-acting antiviral (DAA) protease inhibitors,  telaprevir and boceprevir, to peginterferon alfa (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy  has been shown to significantly improve sustained virologic response rates and thus  has become standard of care. While the efficacy and safety of DAAs has been assessed  in the clinical trial setting, less is known about real-world use of these new  therapies. OBJECTIVES: To (a) evaluate the treatment patterns, health care  utilization, and costs of CHC patients receiving DAA-based therapies in the United  States using a retrospective alysis of a large administrative claims database and  (b) evaluate factors associated with therapy noncompletion using multivariable  alyses. METHODS: Adult patients with ≥u20091 claim for CHC and a prescription filled  for boceprevir or telaprevir were selected from a de-identified U.S.-based claims  database. The date of the first fill for a DAA after May 13, 2011 (date of first DAA  availability) was defined as the index date, and patients were categorized into  either the telaprevir or boceprevir cohort. Patients were required to have  continuous eligibility and no claims for hepatitis B during the 6 months before  (baseline) and 12 months following (study period) the index date. Baseline  characteristics and study period treatment patterns, health care utilization, and  costs were described. Factors associated with therapy noncompletion were examined  using multivariable logistic regression, and adjusted health care costs were  compared between the DAA cohorts using multivariable alyses. RESULTS: A total of  871 telaprevir and 284 boceprevir patients were identified. DAA patients were aged  54 years on average and more often were male (60%, nu2009=u2009688). Approximately 25%  (nu2009=u2009216) of telaprevir and 18% (nu2009=u200952) of boceprevir patients had cirrhosis, and  9% (nu2009=u200982) of telaprevir and 7% (nu2009=u200920) of boceprevir patients had decompensated  cirrhosis at baseline.

Using the population of Olmsted County,  Minnesota, we identified the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed CLL who  experience progression to the point of requiring treatment. Using these data, total  pharmaceutical cost over a 10-year period after diagnosis was estimated for a  hypothetic cohort of 100 newly diagnosed patients under three scerios: before  approval of ibrutinib and idelalisib (historical scerio), after approval of  ibrutinib and idelalisib as salvage therapy (current scerios A and B), and  assuming use of ibrutinib as first-line treatment (potential future scerio).  RESULTS: Estimated 10-year pharmaceutical costs for 100 newly diagnosed patients  were as follows: $4,565,929 (approximately $45,659 per newly diagnosed patient and  $157,446 per treated patient) for the historical scerio, $7,794,843 (approximately  $77,948 per newly diagnosed patient and $268,788 per treated patient) for current  scerio A, $6,309,162 (approximately $63,092 per newly diagnosed patient and  $217,557 per treated patient) for current scerio B, and $16,414,055 (approximately  $164,141 per newly diagnosed patient and $566,002 per treated patient) for the  potential future scerio.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine boys and 19 girls with a mean ± SD age of 6.4xa0±xa02.18  years were randomly divided into group 1-parasacral transcutaneous electrical  stimulation with placebo drug and group 2-oxybutynin with sham scapular electrical  therapy. Success was assessed by 1) the rate of complete symptom resolution, 2) a  visual alog scale of 0 to 10, 3) the dysfunctiol voiding score system, 4)  voiding diary records, 5) Rome III criteria and 6) side effect frequency in each  group. RESULTS: A total of 13 and 15 patients were randomized to groups 1 and 2,  respectively. Symptoms completely resolved in 6 patients in group 1 (46%) and 3xa0in  group 2 (20%) (p = 0.204). A statistically significant improvement was found in the  2 groups in the dysfunctiol voiding score system and voiding diary records.  However, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups in the  visual alog scale score, voiding frequency, and maximum and mean voided volume (p  = 0.295, 0.098, 0.538 and 0.650, respectively). Constipation improved in 100% of  group 1 patients but in only 55% in group 2 (pxa0= 0.031 vs 0.073). Group 1 showed no  side effects while dry mouth, hyperthermia and hyperemia developed in 58%, 25% and  50% of group 2 patients (pxa0=xa00.002, 0.096 and 0.005, respectively).

STUDY DESIGN:  Retrospective chart review of 4698 women attending a New Zealand public hospital  abortion clinic over 2 years (2010-2012) to describe postabortion contraceptive  choice, with follow-up via clinic and tiol births records to assess subsequent  pregncies at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. RESULTS: Twenty percent of the cohort  (934/4698) received an implant, 26% an intrauterine method (927 copper intrauterine  device, 301 levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [LNG-IUS]), and 54% chose  other shorter-acting methods (2536/4698).

STUDY DESIGN:  Retrospective chart review of 4698 women attending a New Zealand public hospital  abortion clinic over 2 years (2010-2012) to describe postabortion contraceptive  choice, with follow-up via clinic and tiol births records to assess subsequent  pregncies at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. RESULTS: Twenty percent of the cohort  (934/4698) received an implant, 26% an intrauterine method (927 copper intrauterine  device, 301 levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [LNG-IUS]), and 54% chose  other shorter-acting methods (2536/4698). Method choice was significantly associated  with age, ethnicity, and pregncy history (p < .001). At 24 months, the udjusted  incidence of subsequent abortion for implant users was 3.8% (95% confidence interval  [CI] = 2.5-5.0) and 11.6% (95% CI = 10.3-12.8) for those choosing other short-acting  methods. By 48 months, 6.6% of implant users had a subsequent abortion (compared  with 18.3% for short-acting methods). The incidence of continued pregncy at 24  months was 6.3% (95% CI = 4.4-8.1) for implant users and 15.7% (95% CI = 14-17.2)  for those choosing other short-acting methods. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for  subsequent abortion were lowest for women initiating an implant (HR = 0.26, 95% CI =  0.20-0.35) or LNG-IUS (HR = 0.26, 0.16-0.44, reference group: short-acting methods).  CONCLUSIONS: Immediate postabortion insertion of an implant significantly reduced  rates of subsequent pregncy for at least 2 years. Abortion service providers  should ensure women have barrier-free access to all long-acting reversible  contraceptions to delay or prevent pregncy. IMPLICATIONS: Initiation of an  levonorgestrel implant immediately postabortion was associated with a 74% reduction  in subsequent abortion over the next 4 years compared with use of short-acting  methods.

However, there are limited data on the  effectiveness of glyburide when compared with insulin as used in a real-world  setting. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of adverse materl and neotal outcomes  in women with GDM treated with glyburide compared with insulin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of a population-based cohort from a  tionwide US employer-based insurance claims database from January 1, 2000, to  December 31, 2011. We identified women with GDM and their newborns. We excluded  those with type 1 or 2 diabetes and those younger than 15 years or older than 45  years. EXPOSURES: Treatment with glyburide or insulin during pregncy within 150  days before delivery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used binomial regression to  estimate risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences with 95% confidence intervals for  the association of glyburide with diagnosis codes for obstetric trauma, cesarean  delivery, birth injury, preterm birth, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, jaundice,  large for gestatiol age, and hospitalization in the neotal intensive care unit.  Inverse probability of treatment weights were used to adjust for materl  characteristics that differed between the treatment groups. RESULTS: Among 110,879  women with GDM, 9173 women (8.3%) were treated with glyburide (nu2009=u20094982) or insulin  (nu2009=u20094191). After adjusting for differences at baseline, newborns of women treated  with glyburide were at increased risk for neotal intensive care unit admission  (RRu2009=u20091.41; 95% CI, 1.23-1.62), respiratory distress (RRu2009=u20091.63; 95% CI, 1.23-2.15),  hypoglycemia (RRu2009=u20091.40; 95% CI, 1.00-1.95), birth injury (RRu2009=u20091.35; 95% CI,  1.00-1.82), and large for gestatiol age (RRu2009=u20091.43; 95% CI, 1.16-1.76) compared  with those treated with insulin; they were not at increased risk for obstetric  trauma (RRu2009=u20090.92; 95% CI, 0.71-1.20), preterm birth (RRu2009=u20091.06; 95% CI, 0.93-1.21),  or jaundice (RRu2009=u20090.96; 95% CI, 0.48-1.91). The risk of cesarean delivery was 3%  lower in the glyburide group (adjusted RRu2009=u20090.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00).

The purpose of this study was to identify factors  associated with longterm changes in BMI. METHODS: Subjects with RA from the Veterans  Affairs (VA) Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) Registry (n = 1474) were studied.  Information on inflammatory markers, presence of erosions, and smoking status were  extracted from the VARA database. BMI was extracted from VA electronic medical  records within 14 days of each visit date. VA pharmacy records were queried to  identify prescriptions for specific RA therapies within 1 month of the visit date.  We used robust generalized estimating equations margil regression models to  calculate independent associations between clinical variables and BMI over time.  Similar models determined predictors of change in weight and risk of weight loss  over the subsequent study observation period. RESULTS: Increasing age, active  smoking, and the presence of erosions at baseline were associated with lower BMI.  Weight decreased over time among older adults. Factors associated with greater  reductions in BMI over time and a greater risk of weight loss were higher  inflammatory markers, smoking, older age, higher BMI, and less subsequent  improvement in inflammation. Methotrexate use was associated with a lower risk of  weight loss. The use of prednisone or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies was not  associated with change in BMI or the risk of weight loss independent of other  factors. CONCLUSION: Greater age, greater inflammatory activity, and active smoking  are associated with greater weight loss in RA over time.FAU - Baker, Joshua FAU - Baker JFAD - From the Division of Rheumatology, and Center for Health Equity Research and  Promotion, Philadelphia Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center; Division of  Rheumatology, and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of  Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Salt Lake City VA  Medical Center and University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Department of Medicine,  Denver VA Medical Center, Denver, Colorado; Department of Medicine, Nebraska-Western  Iowa VA Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.J.F.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors  associated with longterm changes in BMI. METHODS: Subjects with RA from the Veterans  Affairs (VA) Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) Registry (n = 1474) were studied.  Information on inflammatory markers, presence of erosions, and smoking status were  extracted from the VARA database. BMI was extracted from VA electronic medical  records within 14 days of each visit date. VA pharmacy records were queried to  identify prescriptions for specific RA therapies within 1 month of the visit date.  We used robust generalized estimating equations margil regression models to  calculate independent associations between clinical variables and BMI over time.  Similar models determined predictors of change in weight and risk of weight loss  over the subsequent study observation period. RESULTS: Increasing age, active  smoking, and the presence of erosions at baseline were associated with lower BMI.  Weight decreased over time among older adults. Factors associated with greater  reductions in BMI over time and a greater risk of weight loss were higher  inflammatory markers, smoking, older age, higher BMI, and less subsequent  improvement in inflammation. Methotrexate use was associated with a lower risk of  weight loss. The use of prednisone or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies was not  associated with change in BMI or the risk of weight loss independent of other  factors. CONCLUSION: Greater age, greater inflammatory activity, and active smoking  are associated with greater weight loss in RA over time.FAU - Baker, Joshua FAU - Baker JFAD - From the Division of Rheumatology, and Center for Health Equity Research and  Promotion, Philadelphia Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center; Division of  Rheumatology, and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of  Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Salt Lake City VA  Medical Center and University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Department of Medicine,  Denver VA Medical Center, Denver, Colorado; Department of Medicine, Nebraska-Western  Iowa VA Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.J.F.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors  associated with longterm changes in BMI. METHODS: Subjects with RA from the Veterans  Affairs (VA) Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) Registry (n = 1474) were studied.  Information on inflammatory markers, presence of erosions, and smoking status were  extracted from the VARA database. BMI was extracted from VA electronic medical  records within 14 days of each visit date. VA pharmacy records were queried to  identify prescriptions for specific RA therapies within 1 month of the visit date.  We used robust generalized estimating equations margil regression models to  calculate independent associations between clinical variables and BMI over time.  Similar models determined predictors of change in weight and risk of weight loss  over the subsequent study observation period. RESULTS: Increasing age, active  smoking, and the presence of erosions at baseline were associated with lower BMI.  Weight decreased over time among older adults. Factors associated with greater  reductions in BMI over time and a greater risk of weight loss were higher  inflammatory markers, smoking, older age, higher BMI, and less subsequent  improvement in inflammation. Methotrexate use was associated with a lower risk of  weight loss. The use of prednisone or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies was not  associated with change in BMI or the risk of weight loss independent of other  factors. CONCLUSION: Greater age, greater inflammatory activity, and active smoking  are associated with greater weight loss in RA over time.FAU - Baker, Joshua FAU - Baker JFAD - From the Division of Rheumatology, and Center for Health Equity Research and  Promotion, Philadelphia Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center; Division of  Rheumatology, and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of  Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Salt Lake City VA  Medical Center and University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Department of Medicine,  Denver VA Medical Center, Denver, Colorado; Department of Medicine, Nebraska-Western  Iowa VA Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.J.F.

METHODS: Deidentified administrative claims data from  a large, tiol payer were utilized.

Secondary  end-points included acute corory events, heart failure needing hospitalization,  and cerebrovascular disease. Cox regression model adjusting for baseline  characteristics was used to compare the relative risks of different outcomes among  the three different limus-based DES. Totally, 6584 patients were evaluated (n=2142  for SES, n=3445 for E-ZES, and n=997 for EES).

We sought to describe physician-level  changes in GnRH agonist overuse and test the association of time in practice and  solo practice type with GnRH agonist overuse. METHODS: We matched American Medical  Association physician data for 2138 urologists to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End  Result-Medicare data for 12,943 men diagnosed with early-stage and lower-grade  adenocarcinoma of the prostate between 2000 and 2007. We conducted a  population-based, retrospective study using multilevel modeling to control for  patient and provider characteristics. RESULTS: Three distinct patterns of GnRH  agonist overuse were observed. Urologists' time in practice was not associated with  GnRH agonist overuse (odds ratio (OR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI):  0.75-1.05).

In March  2013, generic buprenorphine/loxone tablets were approved in the US. A budget  impact model was built to compare healthcare expenditures for different market  shares of sublingual film and tablet. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to track  a cohort of opioid dependent patients treated with sublingual film or tablet through  the following treatment phases: initiation, maintence, discontinuation,  off-treatment and reinitiation. Transition probabilities and costs for each phase  were estimated from the MarketScan Medicaid database for the period between 1 March  2010 and 30 June 2012. The total expenditure for the plan and expenditure per plan  member per month were predicted over 5 years. Two market share scerios were  considered: 1) sublingual film is progressively replaced by generic tablet (current  situation) and 2) the sublingual film holds a market share of 100%. RESULTS:  Predicted total costs over 5 years were $6400 million when the sublingual film holds  a market share of 100% (as per Scerio 2) which is lower than when sublingual film  is progressively replaced by generic tablet (current situation as per Scerio 1) by  $64 million. These savings were mostly driven by inpatient care ($56 million saved  over 5 years), followed by emergency room care ($27 million) and pharmaceutical  costs ($24 million).

METHODS: A Markov discrete time state transition model  was created to compare postoperative surveillance tapered to 3-year intervals after  5 years of annual surveillance versus conventiol annual surveillance in low-risk  PTC patients with negative neck ultrasound and stimulated thyroglobulin less than  2u2009ng/mL 1 year postoperatively. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were  determined via literature review, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, and  Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data. Sensitivity alyses were performed to  assess areas of uncertainty. RESULTS: The cost of annual surveillance was $5,239 per  patient and yielded 22.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The 3-year strategy  cost $2,601 less, but also yielded 0.01 less QALYs. Thus, the incremental cost per  QALY of annual surveillance was $260,100. Probabilistic sensitivity alysis  demonstrated that less frequent surveillance was more cost effective in 99.98% of  10,000 simulated patients.

Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were  determined via literature review, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, and  Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data. Sensitivity alyses were performed to  assess areas of uncertainty. RESULTS: The cost of annual surveillance was $5,239 per  patient and yielded 22.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The 3-year strategy  cost $2,601 less, but also yielded 0.01 less QALYs. Thus, the incremental cost per  QALY of annual surveillance was $260,100. Probabilistic sensitivity alysis  demonstrated that less frequent surveillance was more cost effective in 99.98% of  10,000 simulated patients. One-way sensitivity alysis revealed that annual  surveillance would be cost effective if the total cost of neck ultrasound could be  reduced to $23 or less.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively alyzed the  records of 225 patients who underwent combined androgen blockade as first line  therapy for prostate cancer. The prognostic values of testosterone and other  clinical factors were evaluated with respect to prostate specific antigen  progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Median patient age was 73.0 years,  median prostate specific antigen was 42.6 ng/ml and median followup was 45.8 months.  No variable associated with testosterone was predictive of progression-free  survival. With regard to overall survival on univariate alysis dir testosterone  less than 16 ng/dl (pxa0=xa00.0190), less than 20 ng/dl (p = 0.0020) and less than 32  ng/dl (p = 0.0146) were significant together with other clinical factors. In  contrast, dir testosterone less than 8 and less than 12 ng/dl were not  significant. Multivariate alysis showed that dir testosterone less than 20 ng/dl  was the significant prognostic factor (p = 0.0048). In addition, time to dir  testosterone was about 1xa0year (11.3xa0months). Patients were divided into rapid and  slow types based on time to testosterone less than 20 ng/dl before and after 6  months, respectively. No significant difference in overall survival was observed  between the 2 types. The current results suggest that the critical factor for  prognosis was not a rapid decrease but whether dir testosterone achieved a level  of less than 20 ng/dl.

The prognostic values of testosterone and other  clinical factors were evaluated with respect to prostate specific antigen  progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Median patient age was 73.0 years,  median prostate specific antigen was 42.6 ng/ml and median followup was 45.8 months.

The estimated cost of our  recommended MRI protocol was US$667.76 without magnetic resonce angiography (MRA)  or US$1501.71 with MRA. CONCLUSIONS: A single contrast-enhanced brain MRI extending  to the T2 level in the chest is an effective and simple means of ruling out  life-threatening and other causative factors of HS. Compared with previous imaging  recommendations, this proposed protocol may be simpler for clinicians to use and  more cost-effective.']",['Evaluation and neuroimaging of the Horner syndrome'],horner syndrome,4104844,horner syndrome,case series study,EMR/EHR,Condition,Nerve disease and pain,34,

METHODS: This was a retrospective  cohort study that used a United States (US) claims database. The study period was  from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2011. The index date was the date of the first  oral bisphosphote (alendrote, ibandrote, or risedrote) prescription and  occurred between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010. The pre- and post-index  periods were the 1-year periods before and after the index date, respectively. The  alysis included women with osteoporosis aged ≥55 years at the index date who were  ive to all osteoporosis treatments before the index date and were continuously  enrolled in the health plan for at least 1 year before and 1 year after the index  date. Patients with a diagnosis of malignt neoplasm during the pre- or post-index  periods or a diagnosis of Paget disease anytime in the claims history were excluded.

Sputum cytology is the  simplest, non-invasive and cost effective technique but it has low sensitivity due  to lack of robust processing methods to retrieve all the diagnostic materials  clogged in mucus, inflammatory exudates and blood. METHODS: This study have compared  conventiol pick and smear method of sputum processing with samples prepared by  homogenization methods using N-acetyl-l-cysteine, Dithiothreitol (DTT), CytoRich red  solution and cell blocks (CBs) with respect to screening time, quality of staining,  cellularity, smear background, nuclear and cytoplasmic morphology preservation, and  diagnostic efficacy. The significance of CB prepared from homogenised samples for  immunocytochemistry, protein extraction, Genomic D and R extraction were also  evaluated on a cohort 3,185 samples. The significance of the morphological features  in each of the techniques was statistically alysed using SPSS 11 software.

People living with HIV have a 5% to 10% annual risk of developing active  tuberculosis (TB) once infected with TB bacilli, compared to a 5% lifetime risk in  HIV-negative people with latent TB infection. Moreover, people living with HIV have  a 20-fold higher risk of dying from TB. A growing body of literature suggests that  IPT reduces overall TB incidence and is therefore of considerable benefit to  patients and the larger community. However, in 2009, of the estimated 33 million  people living with HIV, only 1.7 million (5%) were screened for TB, and about 85,000  (0.2%) were offered IPT. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will examine the use of clinical  decision-support reminders to improve rates of initiation of preventative treatment  in a TB/HIV co-morbid population living in a TB endemic area. This will be a  pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster-randomized superiority trial with a 1:1  allocation to treatment ratio. For the trial, 20 public medical facilities that use  clinical summary sheets generated from an electronic medical records system will  participate as clusters. All HIV-positive adult patients who complete an initial  encounter at a study cluster and at least one return encounter during the study  period will be included in the study cohort. The primary endpoint will be IPT  prescription at 3 months post the initial encounter. We will conduct both  individual-level and cluster-level alyses. Due to the ture of the intervention,  the trial will not be blinded. This study will contribute to the growing evidence  base for the use of electronic health interventions in low-resource settings to  promote high-quality clinical care, health system optimization and positive patient  outcomes.

People living with HIV have a 5% to 10% annual risk of developing active  tuberculosis (TB) once infected with TB bacilli, compared to a 5% lifetime risk in  HIV-negative people with latent TB infection. Moreover, people living with HIV have  a 20-fold higher risk of dying from TB. A growing body of literature suggests that  IPT reduces overall TB incidence and is therefore of considerable benefit to  patients and the larger community. However, in 2009, of the estimated 33 million  people living with HIV, only 1.7 million (5%) were screened for TB, and about 85,000  (0.2%) were offered IPT. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will examine the use of clinical  decision-support reminders to improve rates of initiation of preventative treatment  in a TB/HIV co-morbid population living in a TB endemic area. This will be a  pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster-randomized superiority trial with a 1:1  allocation to treatment ratio. For the trial, 20 public medical facilities that use  clinical summary sheets generated from an electronic medical records system will  participate as clusters. All HIV-positive adult patients who complete an initial  encounter at a study cluster and at least one return encounter during the study  period will be included in the study cohort. The primary endpoint will be IPT  prescription at 3 months post the initial encounter. We will conduct both  individual-level and cluster-level alyses. Due to the ture of the intervention,  the trial will not be blinded. This study will contribute to the growing evidence  base for the use of electronic health interventions in low-resource settings to  promote high-quality clinical care, health system optimization and positive patient  outcomes.

METHODS: United States Rel Data System data were  linked with data from a large dialysis organization.

The aim of this study was to estimate influenza vaccine  effectiveness (VE) among individuals aged 60+ years over three seasons and to assess  if the screening method is a suitable tool to monitor influenza VE in this  particular target-group in Germany. METHODS: We identified laboratory-confirmed  influenza cases aged 60+ years through the tiol communicable disease reporting  system for seasons 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13. Vaccition coverage (VC) data were  retrieved from a database of health insurance claims representing ~85% of the total  German population. We applied the screening method to calculate influenza  subtype-specific VE and compared our results with VE estimates from other  observatiol studies in Europe. RESULTS: In total, 7,156 laboratory-confirmed  influenza cases were included. VE against all influenza types ranged between 49%  (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39-56) in 2011/12 and 80% (95% CI: 76-83%) in  2010/11. In 2010/11 subtype-specific VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B was 76%  and 84%, respectively. In the following seasons, VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm,  A(H3N2) and B was 87%, -9% , 74% (2011/12), and 74%, 39%, 73% (2012/13). VE was  higher among hospitalized compared to non-hospitalized influenza A cases. Seventeen  observatiol studies from Europe reporting subtype-specific VE among the elderly  were identified for the respective seasons (all applying the test-negative design)  and showed comparable subtype-specific VE estimates. CONCLUSIONS: According to our  study, influenza vaccition provided moderate protection against  laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B in individuals aged 60+ but no or  only little protection against A(H3N2). Higher VE among hospitalized cases might  indicate higher protection against severe influenza disease. Based on the available  data, the screening method allowed us to assess subtype-specific VE in hospitalized  and non-hospitalized elderly persons. Since controlling for several important  confounders was not possible, the applied method only provided crude VE estimates.  However, given the precise VC-data and the large number of cases, the screening  method provided results being in line with VE estimates from other observatiol  studies in Europe that applied a different study design.FAU - Remschmidt, CorneliusAU - Remschmidt CAD - Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.

This retrospective review looks at our experiences with hydromorphone  patient-controlled epidural algesia for postoperative algesia in this patient  population. METHODS: Electronic medical records of all children with a diagnosis of  idiopathic scoliosis who underwent PSF surgery at our institution during the period  of January 2011 to October 2011 were reviewed from the time they entered the PACU  through the first 72 hours following PACU discharge. Specifically, the charts were  reviewed for pain scores, sedation scores, rcotic use, use of adjuvant  medications, antiemetics, antipruritics, hours to first ambulation, hours to first  oral intake, respiratory rate, SpO2 values, need for any respiratory interventions,  length of stay, and any adverse events. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled.  Three patients had their epidurals removed within the first 24 hours (5.4% failure  rate).

Specifically, the charts were  reviewed for pain scores, sedation scores, rcotic use, use of adjuvant  medications, antiemetics, antipruritics, hours to first ambulation, hours to first  oral intake, respiratory rate, SpO2 values, need for any respiratory interventions,  length of stay, and any adverse events. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled.  Three patients had their epidurals removed within the first 24 hours (5.4% failure  rate). Highest mean pain scores ranged from 5.6±2.3 to 5.8±2.2 with median pain  scores ranging from 4 to 6. There were no respiratory or neurological adverse  events. Ambulation occurred on either postoperative day 1 or 2. The incidence of  vomiting in this study was 34% in the first 24 hours post-PACU discharge and during  this period, 61% of patients received ondansetron, for either usea or pruritus.  The mean length of stay for our patients was 3.95 days, with a median of 4 days.  CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective review suggests that hydromorphone epidurals used  for pain control in postoperative PSF patients are a reasoble altertive to  IV-PCA, in terms of algesia, side-effect profile, and length of stay.

METHODS: Study subjects required a pregabalin or duloxetine pharmacy  claim between 07/01/2008-06/30/2012 (index event), ≥1 inpatient or ≥2 outpatient  medical claims with pDPN diagnosis between 01/01/2008-12/31/2012, and ≥12xa0months  pre- and ≥6 post-index enrollment.

During the study period, a single generic PTZ (C  manufacturer, Korea) was used. Patients who received PTZ within 24xa0h prior to serum  GM testing were enrolled. Age- and GM test date-matched non-PTZ patients were  selected as controls. A total of 110 patients received PTZ within 24xa0h prior to  serum GM testing during the study period. The GM optical density index (ODI) of the  PTZ group did not vary significantly from that of the control group (pu2009=u20090.251). The  percentage of false-positive patients in the PTZ group was also similar to that of  the control group (pu2009=u20090.538). There was no statistical relationship between GM ODI  titer and time interval from PTZ administration (pu2009=u20090.095) or cumulative PTZ dose  (pu2009=u20090.416).

No randomized clinical trial has compared  exacerbation rates among COPD patients receiving budesonide/formoterol combition  (BFC) and fluticasone/salmeterol combition (FSC) to date, and only limited  comparative data are available. This study compared the real-world effectiveness of  approved BFC and FSC treatments among matched cohorts of COPD patients in a large US  maged care setting. METHODS: COPD patients (≥40 years) ive to ICS/LABA who  initiated BFC or FSC treatments between 03/01/2009-03/31/2012 were identified in a  geographically diverse US maged care database and followed for 12 months; index  date was defined as first prescription fill date. Patients with a cancer diagnosis  or chronic (≥180 days) oral corticosteroid (OCS) use within 12 months prior to index  were excluded. Patients were matched 1-to-1 on demographic and pre-initiation  clinical characteristics using propensity scores from a random forest model. The  primary efficacy outcome was COPD exacerbation rate, and secondary efficacy outcomes  included exacerbation rates by event type and healthcare resource utilization.  Pneumonia objectives included rates of any diagnosis of pneumonia and  pneumonia-related healthcare resource utilization. RESULTS: Matching of the  identified 3,788 BFC and 6,439 FSC patients resulted in 3,697 patients in each  group. Matched patients were well balanced on age (mean=64 years), gender (BFC: 52%  female; FSC: 54%), prior COPD-related medication use, healthcare utilization, and  comorbid conditions. During follow-up, no significant difference was seen between  BFC and FSC patients for number of COPD-related exacerbations overall (rate ratio  [RR]=1.02, 95% CI=[0.96,1.09], p=0.56) or by event type: COPD-related  hospitalizations (RR=0.96), COPD-related ED visits (RR=1.11), and COPD-related  office/outpatient visits with OCS and/or antibiotic use (RR=1.01). The proportion of  patients diagnosed with pneumonia during the post-index period was similar for  patients in each group (BFCu2009=17.3%, FSCu2009=19.0%, odds ratio=0.92 [0.81,1.04],  p=0.19), and no difference was detected for pneumonia-related healthcare utilization  by place of service. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated no difference in  COPD-related exacerbations or pneumonia events between BFC and FSC treatment groups  for patients new to ICS/LABA treatment in a real-world setting.

Patients were matched 1-to-1 on demographic and pre-initiation  clinical characteristics using propensity scores from a random forest model. The  primary efficacy outcome was COPD exacerbation rate, and secondary efficacy outcomes  included exacerbation rates by event type and healthcare resource utilization.  Pneumonia objectives included rates of any diagnosis of pneumonia and  pneumonia-related healthcare resource utilization. RESULTS: Matching of the  identified 3,788 BFC and 6,439 FSC patients resulted in 3,697 patients in each  group. Matched patients were well balanced on age (mean=64 years), gender (BFC: 52%  female; FSC: 54%), prior COPD-related medication use, healthcare utilization, and  comorbid conditions. During follow-up, no significant difference was seen between  BFC and FSC patients for number of COPD-related exacerbations overall (rate ratio  [RR]=1.02, 95% CI=[0.96,1.09], p=0.56) or by event type: COPD-related  hospitalizations (RR=0.96), COPD-related ED visits (RR=1.11), and COPD-related  office/outpatient visits with OCS and/or antibiotic use (RR=1.01). The proportion of  patients diagnosed with pneumonia during the post-index period was similar for  patients in each group (BFCu2009=17.3%, FSCu2009=19.0%, odds ratio=0.92 [0.81,1.04],  p=0.19), and no difference was detected for pneumonia-related healthcare utilization  by place of service. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated no difference in  COPD-related exacerbations or pneumonia events between BFC and FSC treatment groups  for patients new to ICS/LABA treatment in a real-world setting.

We evaluated PC-related treatment patterns and associated health care resource use  among patients with metastatic PC in the United Kingdom and France. METHODS: One  hundred three oncology specialists (53 in France and 50 in the United Kingdom)  abstracted data from medical records of 400 patients whom they treated for  metastatic PC. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of metastatic PC at age 18 years or  older between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012; had ≥3 months of follow-up  time beginning at metastatic diagnosis; and received at least 1 cancer-directed  therapy for metastatic disease.

FINDINGS: Approximately two thirds of patients were men, and  median age at metastatic disease diagnosis was 62.2 years. Nearly all patients  (97.3%) received chemotherapy to treat metastatic disease, 9.3% received radiation  therapy, and 7.8% received a targeted therapy.

We evaluated PC-related treatment patterns and associated health care resource use  among patients with metastatic PC in the United Kingdom and France. METHODS: One  hundred three oncology specialists (53 in France and 50 in the United Kingdom)  abstracted data from medical records of 400 patients whom they treated for  metastatic PC. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of metastatic PC at age 18 years or  older between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012; had ≥3 months of follow-up  time beginning at metastatic diagnosis; and received at least 1 cancer-directed  therapy for metastatic disease. Information on patient demographics, Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, location of primary tumor, presence  of comorbidities, adverse events, and complications were collected.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.  SETTING: tiolly representative 5% sample of Medicare databases. PARTICIPANTS:  Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older who newly initiated cholinesterase  inhibitor therapy between 2006 and 2009. MEASUREMENTS: Pneumonia, defined as the  presence of a diagnosis code for pneumonia as the primary diagnosis on an inpatient  claim or on an emergency department claim followed by dispensing of appropriate  antibiotics. Cox proportiol hazards models were used to estimate the risk of  pneumonia. Subgroup alyses and sensitivity alyses were conducted using  altertive pneumonia definitions and adjustments using high-dimensiol propensity  scores to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The mean age of 35,570 new  users of cholinesterase inhibitors (30,174 users of donepezil, 1,176 users of  galantamine, 4,220 users of rivastigmine) was 82; 75% were women, and 82% were  white. The cumulative incidence of pneumonia was 51.9 per 1,000 person-years. The  risk of pneumonia for rivastigmine users was 24% lower than that of donepezil users  (hazard ratio (HR)=0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.60-0.93). Risk in  galantamine users (HR=0.87, 95% CI=0.62-1.23) was not significantly different from  risk in donepezil users. Results of subgroup and sensitivity alyses were similar  to the primary results. CONCLUSION: The risk of pneumonia was lower in individuals  receiving rivastigmine than in those receiving donepezil. Additiol studies are  needed to confirm the findings of pneumonia risk between the oral and transdermal  forms of rivastigmine and in users of galantamine.']",['Risk of pneumonia in new users of cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia'],rivastigmine,733523,rivastigmine,retrospective,EMR/EHR,Drug,NERVOUS SYSTEM,35570,

Diagnostic testing with the XBT was performed based on a  clinical suspicion for SIBO in patients with symptoms of bloating, abdomil pain,  abdomil distension, weight loss, diarrhea, and/or constipation. Consecutive  electronic medical records of 932 patients who completed the XBT at the University  of Florida between 2005 and 2009 were reviewed.

Racial differences in fracture risk may be related to  differences in bioavailable vitamin D due to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  variations in the vitamin D binding protein (DBP). METHODS: We measured 25(OH)D  levels in 12,781 middle-aged White and Black participants [mean age 57 years (SD  5.7), 25% Black] in the ARIC Study who attended the second examition from  1990-1992.

We used Cox proportiol hazards models to evaluate the association  between 25(OH)D levels and risk of fracture with adjustment for possible  confounders. Interactions were tested by race and DBP genotype. RESULTS: There were  1122 incident fracture-related hospitalizations including 267 hip fractures over a  median of 19.6 years of follow-up. Participants with deficient 25(OH)D (<20 ng/mL)  had a higher risk of any fracture hospitalization [HR=1.21 (95% CI 1.05-1.39)] and  hospitalization for hip fracture [HR=1.35 (1.02-1.79)]. No significant racial  interaction was noted (p-interaction=0.20 for any fracture; 0.74 for hip fracture).  There was no independent association of rs4588 and rs7041 with fracture.

Participants were genotyped for two DBP SNPs (rs4588 and rs7041).  Incident hospitalized fractures were measured by abstracting hospital records for  ICD-9 codes. We used Cox proportiol hazards models to evaluate the association  between 25(OH)D levels and risk of fracture with adjustment for possible  confounders. Interactions were tested by race and DBP genotype. RESULTS: There were  1122 incident fracture-related hospitalizations including 267 hip fractures over a  median of 19.6 years of follow-up. Participants with deficient 25(OH)D (<20 ng/mL)  had a higher risk of any fracture hospitalization [HR=1.21 (95% CI 1.05-1.39)] and  hospitalization for hip fracture [HR=1.35 (1.02-1.79)]. No significant racial  interaction was noted (p-interaction=0.20 for any fracture; 0.74 for hip fracture).  There was no independent association of rs4588 and rs7041 with fracture. However,  there was a margil interaction for 25(OH)D deficiency with rs7041 among Whites  (p-interaction=0.065). Whites with both 25(OH)D deficiency and the GG genotype  [i.e., with predicted higher levels of DBP and lower bioavailable vitamin D] were at  the greatest risk for any fracture [HR=1.48 (1.10-2.00)] compared to Whites with the  TT genotype and replete 25(OH)D (reference group). CONCLUSIONS: Deficient 25(OH)D  levels are associated with higher incidence of hospitalized fractures.

METHODS: The records of 41,726 patients  with breast cancer (28,266 received TMX and 13,460 did not) were obtained from the  Taiwan tiol Health Insurance Research Database for the period from January 2000  to December 2008. Three-fold women without breast cancer were the control group (Nxa0=  125, 178). The main end point was developing hyperlipidemia during the follow-up.  RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 9 years, the patients with breast cancer  demonstrated a rate of developing hyperlipidemia that was 6% less (adjusted hazard  ratio [HR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.97) than that of the control  participants without breast cancer.

Dialysis facilities could either adopt  the bundle completely (100%) in the first year of launch, or phase-in (25%) over  four years. Differences in practice patterns and patient outcomes were hypothesized  to occur in facilities that phased-in 25% compared to those that did not. METHODS:  Data are from STEPPS, a study of 51 small dialysis organization facilities designed  to describe trends in dialytic treatment before and after bundle implementation.  Baseline was defined as October-December 2010; follow-up as January-December 2011.  Facility- and patient-level data were collected at enrollment and regularly  thereafter. Cox proportiol hazards and linear multi-level models were used to  estimate the effect of opting-in 25% (vs. 100%) on practice patterns and clinical  outcomes.

Eleven patients underwent additiol intervention (7 surgical releases and 4 repeat  injections) at a median of 129 days (range, 42-365) after the injection.

The electronic medical records of study infants were reviewed to establish  the incidence of Candida sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 464 ELBW infants were admitted  to the NICU during the study period. Three infants (0.65%) developed Candida sepsis.  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These data demonstrate that a topical nystatin cream  protocol is associated with a very low rate of Candida sepsis in ELBW infants with  central catheters. The use of this protocol may contribute to a decrease in the  morbidity and mortality rate associated with catheter-associated Candida infections  in ELBW infants. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Before generalizations can be made as to  the safety and efficacy of this protocol as compared to enteral and parenteral  prophylactic treatments and in other institutions, large multicenter randomized  controlled trials are required.FAU - Bodin, Mary BethAU - Bodin MBAD - University of Alabama School of Nursing, Birmingham, and NICU, DCH Regiol Medical  Center, Tuscaloosa, Alabama (Dr Bodin); NICU, DCH Regiol Medical Center,  Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and University of Alabama Departments of Pediatrics and  Obstetrics, Tuscaloosa (Dr Godoy); and Department of Pediatrics, Division of  Neotology, University of Alabama at Birmingham (Dr Philips).FAU - Godoy, GuillermoAU - Godoy G']",['Topical Nystatin for the Prevention of Catheter-Associated Candidiasis in ELBW  Infants'],infection control,4298121,infection control,retrospective,EMR/EHR,Procedure,,,
