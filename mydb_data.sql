METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with  de Quervain tendinopathy treated with corticosteroid injections (lidocaine plus  triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone) were prospectively enrolled. Patients with  inflammatory arthritis, carpometacarpal osteoarthritis, or a previous distal radius  fracture affecting the symptomatic wrist were excluded. Demographic data and  information on existing comorbidities were recorded. Patients were seen in clinic at  6 weeks after injection and contacted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following injection  to determine symptom recurrence and further intervention. Medical records were also  reviewed for this purpose. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression  modeling were used to estimate recurrence rates and identify predictors of symptom  recurrence and repeat intervention. RESULTS: Fifty wrists in 50 patients (average  age, 49 y) were included. One patient was lost to follow-up. Eighty-two percent of  patients had resolved symptoms 6 weeks after a steroid injection. Twenty-four  patients had a recurrence of symptoms at a median of 84 days after the injection.  Eleven patients underwent additional intervention (7 surgical releases and 4 repeat  injections) at a median of 129 days (range, 42-365) after the injection. Estimated  freedom from symptom recurrence was 52% at 6 and 12 months. Estimated freedom from  repeat intervention was 81% at 6 months and 77% at 12 months. Two of 3 patients with  a history of trigger finger required subsequent de Quervain surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We  demonstrated that a single cortisone injection was effective in alleviating symptoms  of de Quervain tendinopathy in 82% of patients and that over half remained  symptom-free for at least 12 months. All patients with recurring symptoms developed  them within the first 6 months. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.', NULL, NULL);

METHODS: We performed a retrospective  cross-sectional study to analyze patient characteristics who underwent the XBT for  evaluation of SIBO. Diagnostic testing with the XBT was performed based on a  clinical suspicion for SIBO in patients with symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain,  abdominal distension, weight loss, diarrhea, and/or constipation. Consecutive  electronic medical records of 932 patients who completed the XBT at the University  of Florida between 2005 and 2009 were reviewed. A two-way Analysis of Variance  (ANOVA) was used to test for several associations including age, gender, and body  mass index (BMI) with a +XBT. A two-way ANOVA was also performed to control for the  differences and interaction with age and between genders. A similar analysis was  repeated for BMI. Associations between medical conditions and prior surgical  histories were conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel method for 2 by 2 contingency  tables, stratified for gender. Reported odds ratio estimates reflect the odds of the  prevalence of a condition within the +XBT group to that of the -XBT group. P values  of less than 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In  the 932 consecutive eligible subjects studied, 513 had a positive XBT. A positive  association was found between female gender and a positive XBT (P = 0.0025), and  females with a positive test were, on average, greater than 5 years older than those  with a negative test (P = 0.024). The mean BMI of positive XBT subjects was normal  (24.5) and significantly lower than the subjects with a negative XBT (29.5) (P =  0.0050). A positive XBT was associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)  (OR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.80, P = 0.04), peptic ulcer disease (PUD) (OR = 2.61;  95%CI: 1.48-4.59, P < 0.01), gastroparesis (GP) (OR = 2.04; 95%CI: 1.21-3.41, P <  0.01) and steroid use (OR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.80, P = 0.01). Irritable bowel  syndrome, independent proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) usage, or previous abdominal  surgery was not significantly associated with a positive XBT. No single subdivision  by gender or PPI use was associated with a significant difference in the odds ratios  between any of the subsets. CONCLUSION: Female gender, lower BMI, steroid use, PUD,  GERD (independent of PPI use), and GP were more prevalent in patients with SIBO,  determined by a positive XBT. Increasing age was associated with SIBO in females,  but not in males.FAU - Schatz, Richard AAU - Schatz RAAD - Richard A Schatz, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina,  Charleston, SC 29425, United States.FAU - Zhang, QingAU - Zhang QAD - Richard A Schatz, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina,  Charleston, SC 29425, United States.FAU - Lodhia, NileshAU - Lodhia NAD - Richard A Schatz, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina,  Charleston, SC 29425, United States.FAU - Shuster, JonathanAU - Shuster JAD - Richard A Schatz, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina,  Charleston, SC 29425, United States.FAU - Toskes, Phillip PAU - Toskes PPAD - Richard A Schatz, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina,  Charleston, SC 29425, United States.', NULL, NULL);

There was no clear association between GI issues and ASD,  with symptoms occurring in 78.9% of all subjects and 78.2% of ASD subjects. The most  commonly reported symptoms were gastroesophageal reflux (56.7%) and constipation  (60%), with 30% of subjects reporting both. The most common treatments were  polyethylene glycol for constipation and proton pump inhibitors for reflux.  Behaviors such as irritability and aggressiveness improved with treatment of GI  symptoms in several subjects.

This replaced a guideline to start aperients after 24h of enteral nutrition  if no bowel action had occurred. We sought to determine the effect of this change on  the incidence of diarrhoea and constipation in intensive care. METHODS:  Retrospective audit of the medical records of consecutive adult patients admitted to  intensive care and given enteral nutrition, excluding those with a primary  gastrointestinal system diagnosis, between Jan-Aug 2011 (the delayed group, n=175)  and Jan-Aug 2012 (the early group, n=175). The early aperient guideline was  implemented during Sep-Dec 2011. RESULTS: The early and delayed groups were similar  in age (median 62 years vs. 64 years; P=0.17), sex (males 65% vs. 63%; P=0.91), and  postoperative cases (31% vs. 33%; P=0.82) and had similar proportions who received  mechanical ventilation (95% vs. 95%; P=1.00), an inotrope or vasopressor (63% vs.  70%; P=0.17), renal replacement therapy (8% vs. 10%; P=0.71), opiates (77% vs. 80%;  P=0.60), antibiotics (89% vs. 91%; P=0.72) and metoclopramide (46% vs. 55%; P=0.11).  A significantly larger proportion of the early group received an aperient (54% vs.  29%, P<0.001) and experienced diarrhoea (38% vs. 27%, P=0.04), but the groups had  similar proportions affected by constipation (42% vs. 43%, P=0.91). CONCLUSIONS:  Changing guidelines from delayed to early aperient administration was associated  with an increase in the incidence of diarrhoea but was not associated with the  incidence of constipation. These findings do not support changing guidelines from  delayed to early aperient administration.', NULL, NULL);

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine boys and 19 girls with a mean ± SD age of 6.4xa0±xa02.18  years were randomly divided into group 1-parasacral transcutaneous electrical  stimulation with placebo drug and group 2-oxybutynin with sham scapular electrical  therapy. Success was assessed by 1) the rate of complete symptom resolution, 2) a  visual analog scale of 0 to 10, 3) the dysfunctional voiding score system, 4)  voiding diary records, 5) Rome III criteria and 6) side effect frequency in each  group. RESULTS: A total of 13 and 15 patients were randomized to groups 1 and 2,  respectively. Symptoms completely resolved in 6 patients in group 1 (46%) and 3xa0in  group 2 (20%) (p = 0.204). A statistically significant improvement was found in the  2 groups in the dysfunctional voiding score system and voiding diary records.  However, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups in the  visual analog scale score, voiding frequency, and maximum and mean voided volume (p  = 0.295, 0.098, 0.538 and 0.650, respectively). Constipation improved in 100% of  group 1 patients but in only 55% in group 2 (pxa0= 0.031 vs 0.073).

Treatment was  discontinued by 13.3% of patients in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: Parasacral transcutaneous  electrical stimulation was as effective as oxybutynin to treat overactive bladder in  children. However, transcutaneous parasacral electrical stimulation was more  effective against constipation and showed no detectable side effects. Oxybutynin was  more effective for decreasing voiding frequency.', NULL, NULL);

In an administrative claims  analysis of over 11,407 patients, approximately one in eight patients had a new or  recurrent fragility-related fracture in the 2 years following teriparatide  initiation. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to describe the risk of  fragility-related fractures in the 2 years following the initiation of teriparatide  in a real-world setting. METHODS: This retrospective study used data from the 2002  to 2011 MarketScan® Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases to identify  patients 50 years and older with a diagnosis of osteoporosis (ICD-9-CM code 733.0x)  who were initiating teriparatide. Patients were required to have continuous medical  and pharmacy benefit coverage for the 12 months prior to and 24 months following  teriparatide initiation (index event). Teriparatide treatment patterns (persistence  and adherence) were described, as was the use of antiresorptive therapy. The primary  study outcome was the presence of a new or recurring fragility fracture following  the initiation of teriparatide. RESULTS: A total of 11,407 patients met the study  criteria (mean age = 69.5, standard deviation = 10.6 years; 92.0% female). One in  four (25.6%) patients had fragility fracture claims in the year prior to  teriparatide initiation, of which 64.0% were on existing antiresorptive therapy.  Overall, 13.4% (n = 1527) of patients had a new or recurrent fracture during the  2-year follow-up period. Forty-eight percent of patients on teriparatide treatment  were considered persistent; fragility fractures were more common among patients  nonpersistent with teriparatide (15.2%) than among those persistent with  teriparatide (11.4%). A higher fracture rate (35.7%) was observed in the cohort with  previous fragility fracture then those without pre-index fractures (24%).

METHODS: This retrospective analysis of a US claims database  identified women initiating an OP medication from 1 January 2002 to 30 June 2009.  Patients were ≥55 years and had ≥1 pharmacy claim for a bisphosphonate or  non-bisphosphonate (raloxifene, calcitonin, teriparatide); the index date was the  first pharmacy claim. There were three study periods: baseline (12 months  pre-index); compliance period (0-12 months post-index); and follow-up period (12-24  months post-index). Medication possession ratio (MPR) was calculated during the  compliance period to differentiate two cohorts: compliant (MPRu2009≥u200980%) and  noncompliant (MPRu2009<u200980%). Outcomes during follow-up were modeled by logistic  regression (presence of fracture), Poisson regression (healthcare utilization  incidence rate) and gamma regression (healthcare costs), all adjusted for patient  demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 685,505 women initiating  OP therapy were identified and 57,913 (8.4%) met the inclusion criteria: only 23,430  (40.5%) were compliant and 34,483 (59.5%) were noncompliant. Mean age was 64 years.  Noncompliance was associated with a 20% higher risk of any fracture (odds ratio:  1.20, 95% CIu2009=u20091.07-1.35), a higher incidence rate ratio (IRR) for inpatient  utilization (IRR: 1.26, 95% CIu2009=u20091.19-1.34) and a lower rate of outpatient  utilization (IRR: 0.97, 95% CIu2009=u20090.95-0.98).

LIMITATIONS: Inclusion in this study required 36 months of continuous healthcare  coverage. Thus, the results are primarily applicable to a stable, managed care  population and may not be generalizable to other populations. CONCLUSION:  Noncompliance with OP therapy was associated with a higher risk of fracture, higher  all-cause medical costs and a higher frequency of inpatient service utilization.

METHODS: This was a retrospective  cohort study that used a United States (US) claims database. The study period was  from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2011. The index date was the date of the first  oral bisphosphonate (alendronate, ibandronate, or risedronate) prescription and  occurred between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010. The pre- and post-index  periods were the 1-year periods before and after the index date, respectively. The  analysis included women with osteoporosis aged ≥55 years at the index date who were  naive to all osteoporosis treatments before the index date and were continuously  enrolled in the health plan for at least 1 year before and 1 year after the index  date. Patients with a diagnosis of malignant neoplasm during the pre- or post-index  periods or a diagnosis of Paget disease anytime in the claims history were excluded.  The occurrence of GI events (defined as esophagitis; gastroesophageal reflux  disease; ulcer, stricture, perforation, or hemorrhage of the esophagus; gastric,  duodenal, or peptic ulcer; acute gastritis; duodenitis; GI hemorrhage;  nausea/vomiting; or dysphagia) was assessed during the pre-index period and at 3, 6,  and 12 months in the post-index period. The rate of GI events was defined as the  percentage of patients having at least 1 GI event in each analysis period (ie,  pre-index and post-index periods). GI events in the post-index period were also  stratified by the presence of GI events in the pre-index period. FINDINGS: A total  of 75,593 women were included in the analysis. The average age at the index date was  64.4 years. Gastroprotective agents were used by 17.9% of patients. Approximately  one fourth of patients (26.6%; n = 20,073) had ≥1 GI events in the pre-index period.  Approximately the same proportion of patients (28.0%; n = 21,142) experienced GI  events in the post-index period. The cumulative rate of GI events during the  post-index period was higher among patients who had GI events in the pre-index  period (51.2%) than among patients without a GI event in the pre-index period  (19.6%).

METHODS: The records of 41,726 patients  with breast cancer (28,266 received TMX and 13,460 did not) were obtained from the  Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database for the period from January 2000  to December 2008. Three-fold women without breast cancer were the control group (Nxa0=  125, 178). The main end point was developing hyperlipidemia during the follow-up.  RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 9 years, the patients with breast cancer  demonstrated a rate of developing hyperlipidemia that was 6% less (adjusted hazard  ratio [HR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.97) than that of the control  participants without breast cancer.

These isolates are one step closer to full  fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance and may lead to delayed response to FQ therapy. Our  study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of high-MIC FQSEC in ambulatory urinary  tract infections (UTIs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted at  outpatient services within the University of Pennsylvania Health System,  Philadelphia. All female subjects with non-recurrent UTI caused by FQSEC  (levofloxacin MICu200a<u200a4 mg/L) were enrolled. Cases were subjects with high-MIC FQSEC  UTI (levofloxacin MIC >0.12 butu200a<u200a4 mg/L) and controls were subjects with low-MIC  FQSEC UTI (levofloxacin MIC ≤0.12 mg/L).

We experienced a sudden rise in Bcc bloodstream  infections in a 786-bed hospital. An investigation was conducted to identify the  source and to intervene in the ongoing infections. METHODS: The cases were defined  as patients with positive blood cultures for Bcc from October 10, 2013-December 16,  2013. We reviewed medical records, interviewed health care workers, and audited the  clinical laboratory. A microbiologic culture for a suspected antiseptic was  performed, and interventions were instituted. RESULTS: During the outbreak period,  Bcc were isolated from 46 blood cultures from 40 patients. The temporal and spatial  distributions did not reveal common factors. The clinical features of the case  patients suggested pseudobacteremia. A 0.5% chlorhexidine solution product was found  to be contaminated with Bcc and had been misused as a skin antiseptic during blood  culture.

Catheter-related  bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) are a common and potentially fatal complication of  HPN. The risk factors for development of CR-BSI in the outpatient setting are poorly  understood. METHODS: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of 225  patients discharged from Barnes-Jewish Hospital on HPN between January 1, 2007, and  December 31, 2009. HPN complications were defined as any cause that led to either  premature discontinuation of HPN therapy or catheter replacement. CR-BSI events were  identified by provider documentation. We calculated the overall complication rate  and the complication rate specifically due to CR-BSI. Backward stepwise Cox  regression analyses were used to assess for independent predictors of  catheter-related complications. RESULTS: In total, 111 of 225 patients (49%)  developed complications while receiving HPN (incidence = 5.06 episodes/1000 catheter  days). Sixty-eight of 225 patients (30%) required catheter removal for CR-BSI  (incidence = 3.10 episodes/1000 catheter days). Independent predictors of line  removal specifically due to infection included anticoagulant use, ulcer or open  wound, and Medicare or Medicaid insurance. The following risk factors were  associated with catheter-associated complications and/or CR-BSI: the presence of  ulcers, the use of systemic anticoagulants, public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid),  and patient age. Independent predictors of line removal for any complication  included age and anticoagulant use. CONCLUSION: Catheter-related complications were  extremely common in patients receiving HPN.

Vitamin D3 is predominantly provided by the action of  UVB from sunlight on skin. Average UK diets supply 2-3 μg/d vitamin D but diets  containing at least one portion of oily fish per week supply about 7 μg/d.  Pharmacological doses of vitamin D2 (bolus injection of 7500 μg or intakes >50 μg/d)  result in a smaller increase in plasma 25(OH)D than those of D3 but physiological  doses 5-25 μg/d seem equivalent. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations are also influenced  by clothing, obesity and skin pigmentation. Up to 40 % of the population have plasma  25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/l in the winter compared with <10 % in the summer.

There is no evidence to support claims of reduced  CVD from existing trials with bone-related health outcomes where vitamin D was  usually co-administered with calcium.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors  associated with longterm changes in BMI. METHODS: Subjects with RA from the Veterans  Affairs (VA) Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) Registry (n = 1474) were studied.  Information on inflammatory markers, presence of erosions, and smoking status were  extracted from the VARA database. BMI was extracted from VA electronic medical  records within 14 days of each visit date. VA pharmacy records were queried to  identify prescriptions for specific RA therapies within 1 month of the visit date.  We used robust generalized estimating equations marginal regression models to  calculate independent associations between clinical variables and BMI over time.  Similar models determined predictors of change in weight and risk of weight loss  over the subsequent study observation period. RESULTS: Increasing age, active  smoking, and the presence of erosions at baseline were associated with lower BMI.  Weight decreased over time among older adults. Factors associated with greater  reductions in BMI over time and a greater risk of weight loss were higher  inflammatory markers, smoking, older age, higher BMI, and less subsequent  improvement in inflammation. Methotrexate use was associated with a lower risk of  weight loss. The use of prednisone or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies was not  associated with change in BMI or the risk of weight loss independent of other  factors.

We studied the association of timing of ESA initiation, agent  (epoetin alfa, darbepoetin) and number of weeks of ESA use with response in MDS  patients in routine practice. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MDS from 2001 to 2005  were identified in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked  database. The study cohort consisted of patients with new-onset transfusion  dependence (TD). All patients received an ESA at least once during the study period,  which began the week that criteria for TD were met and continued until transfusion  independence (TI). Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox Proportional Hazard models were  used to assess relationships between time to ESA initiation, agent and number of  weeks of ESA use and TI attainment. RESULTS: Of 610 TD patients treated with ESAs,  210 (34.4%) achieved TI. Median time from ESA initiation to TI was 13 weeks. Shorter  time from TD to ESA initiation and use of darbepoetin were associated with higher  probability of achieving TI. The probability of achieving TI decreased beyond 8  weeks of treatment, and was very low beyond 16 weeks (8-15 weeks: HR=0.64, 16-31  weeks: HR=0.25, 32+ weeks HR=0.10).

This has implications for the real-world cost of  treatment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the utilization patterns and costs associated with  the use of etanercept, adalimumab, and ustekinumab among patients with  moderate-to-severe psoriasis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional  study. Patients with 2 or more medical claims with a diagnosis of psoriasis  (excluding psoriatic arthritis) who were enrolled in large employer-sponsored health  plans (including a pharmacy benefit) in the United States from January 2007 to March  2012 were identified and extracted from the MarketScan Commercial Encounters  Database. Patients aged at least 18 years were required to have 2 or more pharmacy  claims for etanercept, adalimumab, or ustekinumab; the index date was the first  biologic fill date. Demographics and comorbidities were identified during the 1-year  pre-index period, and medication utilization and costs were evaluated in the 1-year  post-index period after a titration period according to the product prescribing  information (2 weeks to 12 weeks). Medication utilization parameters such as dose  escalation, dose reduction, persistence, switching, discontinuation, and restarts  were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 months from the end of the dose titration window.  RESULTS: A total of 4,309 patients were included with a mean average age of 46  years, and 55% were male. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were started on  etanercept, 39% on adalimumab, and 5% on ustekinumab. Patients had substantial dose  escalation rates (etanercept: 41%; adalim-umab: 37%; ustekinumab: 36%, Pu2009 less than  u20090.05) and discontinuation rates (etanercept: 35%; adalimumab: 27%; ustekinumab:  16%, Pu2009 less than u20090.05) over the 12-month post-titration period. Many patients also  restarted the same biologic (etanercept: 37%; adalimumab: 10%; ustekinumab: 6%, Pu2009  less than u20090.05) or switched to another biologic (etanercept: 15%; adalimumab: 10%;  ustekinumab: 5%, Pu2009 less than u20090.05) over the 12-month post-titration period. The  persistence rates over 12 months were 19%, 53%, and 71% for etanercept, adalimumab,  and ustekinumab, respectively (Pu2009 less than u20090.05). Close to one-third of the  patients at 6 months and 39% at 12 months postdose titration experienced a dose  escalation. Approximately half of the patients who experienced a dose escalation  also had a discontinuation or a dose reduction over the 12-month post-titration  period.

DESIGN: Retrospective, propensity matched cohort study. SETTING:  Optum Labs Data Warehouse, a large database including administrative claims data on  privately insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees. PARTICIPANTS: New users of  dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin from 1 November 2010 to 30 September 2013.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rates (events/100 patient years) and propensity  score matched Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate rates of total  gastrointestinal bleeds, upper gastrointestinal bleeds, and lower gastrointestinal  bleeds for the novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in patients with and  without atrial fibrillation. Heterogeneity of treatment effect related to age was  examined using a marginal effects model. RESULTS: The incidence of gastrointestinal  bleeding associated with dabigatran was 2.29 (95% confidence interval 1.88 to 2.79)  per 100 patient years and that associated with warfarin was 2.87 (2.41 to 3.41) per  100 patient years in patients with atrial fibrillation. In non-atrial fibrillation  patients, the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4.10 (2.47 to 6.80) per 100  patient years with dabigatran and 3.71 (2.16 to 6.40) per 100 patient years with  warfarin. With rivaroxaban, 2.84 (2.30 to 3.52) gastrointestinal bleeding events per  100 patient years occurred in atrial fibrillation patients (warfarin 3.06 (2.49 to  3.77)/100 patient years) and 1.66 (1.23 to 2.24) per 100 patient years in non-atrial  fibrillation patients (warfarin 1.57 (1.25 to 1.99)/100 patient years). In  propensity score matched models, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with novel  oral anticoagulants was similar to that with warfarin in atrial fibrillation  patients (dabigatran v warfarin, hazard ratio 0.79 (0.61 to 1.03); rivaroxaban v  warfarin, 0.93 (0.69 to 1.25)) and in non-AF patients (dabigatran v warfarin, hazard  ratio 1.14 (0.54 to 2.39); rivaroxaban v warfarin, 0.89 (0.60 to 1.32)). The risk of  gastrointestinal bleeding increased after age 65, such that by age 76 the risk  exceeded that with warfarin among atrial fibrillation patients taking dabigatran  (hazard ratio 2.49 (1.61 to 3.83)) and patients with and without atrial fibrillation  taking rivaroxaban (2.91 (1.65 to 4.81) and 4.58 (2.40 to 8.72), respectively).

Nevertheless, a few  case studies have shown liver toxicities of tacrolimus, particularly in patients on  multiple medications. This study is a retrospective data analysis on the potential  of tacrolimus hepatotoxicity. METHODS: A data analysis was conducted on the  electronic medical records (EMRs) of 2,462 Korean patients taking tacrolimus or  cyclosporine from 2002 through to 2008. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total  bilirubin level (TBL) were also monitored. The maximum ALT, time to reach ALTmax  (TALTmax), and TBL(ALTmax) were compared between the tacrolimus and cyclosporine  groups. Other possible factors that may aggravate liver function were also  investigated. RESULTS: ALTmax and TBL(ALTmax) were higher in the tacrolimus group  compared to the cyclosporine group (i.e., 50 IU/L vs. 41 IU/L and 1 mg/dL vs. 0.9  mg/dL, respectively), and TALTmax was shorter (i.e., 101 days vs. 142 days) in the  tacrolimus group. In addition, the frequency of ALTmax > 3x upper limit of normal  (ULN) (i.e., ALTmax > 120) was significantly increased in the tacrolimus group  compared to the cyclosporine group (30% vs. 21%). The severity of tacrolimusinduced  liver damage was greater in patients with history of liver disease, as indicated by  > two-fold greater ALTmax than that of cyclosporine (i.e., 153 IU/L vs. 65 IU/L).  Moreover, the ALTmax was significantly lowered by switching from tacrolimus to  cyclosporine in patients with a history of liver disease. In patients with  preexisting renal disease, neither tacrolimus nor cyclosporine showed any effect on  ALTmax.

The recent addition of 2 direct-acting antiviral (DAA) protease inhibitors,  telaprevir and boceprevir, to peginterferon alfa (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy  has been shown to significantly improve sustained virologic response rates and thus  has become standard of care. While the efficacy and safety of DAAs has been assessed  in the clinical trial setting, less is known about real-world use of these new  therapies. OBJECTIVES: To (a) evaluate the treatment patterns, health care  utilization, and costs of CHC patients receiving DAA-based therapies in the United  States using a retrospective analysis of a large administrative claims database and  (b) evaluate factors associated with therapy noncompletion using multivariable  analyses. METHODS: Adult patients with ≥u20091 claim for CHC and a prescription filled  for boceprevir or telaprevir were selected from a de-identified U.S.-based claims  database. The date of the first fill for a DAA after May 13, 2011 (date of first DAA  availability) was defined as the index date, and patients were categorized into  either the telaprevir or boceprevir cohort. Patients were required to have  continuous eligibility and no claims for hepatitis B during the 6 months before  (baseline) and 12 months following (study period) the index date. Baseline  characteristics and study period treatment patterns, health care utilization, and  costs were described. Factors associated with therapy noncompletion were examined  using multivariable logistic regression, and adjusted health care costs were  compared between the DAA cohorts using multivariable analyses. RESULTS: A total of  871 telaprevir and 284 boceprevir patients were identified. DAA patients were aged  54 years on average and more often were male (60%, nu2009=u2009688). Approximately 25%  (nu2009=u2009216) of telaprevir and 18% (nu2009=u200952) of boceprevir patients had cirrhosis, and  9% (nu2009=u200982) of telaprevir and 7% (nu2009=u200920) of boceprevir patients had decompensated  cirrhosis at baseline. Less than 1% (nu2009=u20099) of patients were HIV co-infected.  Approximately 54% (nu2009=u2009470) of telaprevir and 74% (nu2009=u2009210) of boceprevir patients  did not complete the minimum duration of therapy as per the prescribing information  (telaprevir: 12 weeks of tripleu2009+u200912 weeks of dual; boceprevir: 3 weeks of  lead-inu2009+u200924 weeks of triple). In multivariable analyses, females (vs. males) and  patients taking boceprevir (vs. telaprevir) were more likely to not complete therapy  (Pu2009=u20090.011). CHC patients experienced high medical and drug-related resource  utilization. Telaprevir patients had numerically higher study period unadjusted  medical (boceprevir: $16,927; telaprevir: $19,519) and drug costs (boceprevir:  $59,953; telaprevir: $76,497) than boceprevir patients; however, after adjusting for  baseline characteristics, only drug costs remained significantly different (Pu2009 less  than u20090.001).xa0 CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a large proportion of CHC  patients receiving telaprevir or boceprevir did not complete minimum duration of  therapy as per the prescribing information.

The purpose  of this article is to provide a factual basis for evaluating the claims regarding  the benefits of Sovaldi® relative to its costs. METHODS: A comprehensive review was  conducted of news stories highlighted in the daily updates of the electronic  newsletters BIO SmartBrief, FiercePharma, FierceBiotech and BioCentury Extra  published from November 1, 2013, through December 31, 2014, on the topics of the HCV  market, Sovaldi®, and other HCV therapeutics. Also reviewed were recent practice  guidelines on the management of HCV infections, prescribing information on all HCV  drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and health technology  assessments of Sovaldi® and Harvoni(TM) (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir). FINDINGS: Sovaldi®  and Harvoni(TM) have provided significant improvements in the treatment of HCV, with  all-oral regimens and cure rates exceeding 90% in some populations of patients with  HCV. Sovaldi® prevents significant health care resource utilization in patients who  would otherwise develop cirrhosis and require a liver transplant; however, only a  small proportion of patients with HCV develop cirrhosis, and fewer require liver  transplants. Because it is not possible to identify those patients whose HCV will  progress to severe liver disease, it would be necessary to treat a large number of  patients with HCV to prevent disease progression in this subpopulation, resulting in  a considerable loss to health plans even over a 20-year horizon. The claim that  treating all patients with HCV with Sovaldi® would cost nearly as much as the  current total US expenditure on all prescription drugs, while factually correct, is  not a realistic scenario. Many patients with HCV will continue to go undiagnosed. In  addition, the medical expense for those who are treated will be spread out over many  years. However, the unexpectedly large, up-front cost of covering these drugs has  had a major impact on health plan budgets, resulting in losses for some plans.  IMPLICATIONS: Sovaldi® represents an enormous advance in the care of some  populations of HCV-infected patients, but also a major cost burden to health plans.  As the first of a number of anticipated, paradigm-changing drugs to treat medical  conditions affecting large patient populations, Sovaldi® should act as a wake-up  call for all health care stakeholders to engage in a meaningful, fact-based  discussion about managing the cost of innovative new drugs to balance the needs of  drug manufacturers, health plans, providers, and, above all, patients.', NULL, NULL);

RESULTS: Among 1,115 anti-HCV+  patients, 133 (11.9%) were also HIV-positive. Of these, 77.4% (n=103) underwent HCV  RNA testing to determine current infection status. By contrast, 66.7% (n=654/980) of  anti-HCV+ patients who were HIV-negative received HCV RNA testing. Following  multivariable adjustment, the odds of receiving HCV RNA testing were higher among  anti-HCV+ patients who were also HIV-positive (AOR=1.9, 95% CI=1.2, 3.0), compared  with their HIV-negative counterparts. Elevated alanine aminotransferase level was  also associated with receipt of HCV RNA testing (AOR=1.9, 95% CI=1.4, 2.4). Black  race was associated with decreased odds of receiving HCV RNA testing (AOR=0.7, 95%  CI=0.5, 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection status is independently associated with the  likelihood of receiving HCV RNA testing following an anti-HCV+ result. One quarter  of anti-HCV+ patients who were also HIV-positive and one third of their HIV-negative  counterparts, respectively, did not receive testing to establish active HCV  infection, which is imperative for appropriate care and treatment.', NULL, NULL);

Few studies have examined the effect of postoperative delirium on outcomes  after cardiac surgery. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between delirium after  cardiac surgery and the following outcomes: length of stay after surgery, prevalence  of falls, discharge to a nursing facility, discharge to home with home health  services, and use of inpatient physical therapy. METHODS: Electronic medical records  of 656 cardiac surgery patients were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS:  Postoperative delirium occurred in 161 patients (24.5%). Patients with postoperative  delirium had significantly longer stays (P < .001) and greater prevalence of falls  (P < .001) than did patients without delirium. Patients with delirium also had a  significantly greater likelihood for discharge to a nursing facility (P < .001) and  need for home health services if discharged to home (P < .001) and a significantly  higher need for inpatient physical therapy (P < .001). Compared with patients  without postoperative delirium, patients who had this complication were more likely  to have received zolpidem and benzodiazepines postoperatively and to have a history  of arrhythmias, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Patients  who have delirium after cardiac surgery have poorer outcomes than do similar  patients without this complication.

However, the duration of treatment in responders is unclear, and treatment of  patients with genetic causes is a matter of debate. METHODS: Thirty-six patients  with SRNS were studied retrospectively.

METHODS: Chronic PPI use is associated with masking of H. pylori infection. Patients  with H. pylori infection are predisposed to gastric and duodenal ulcers, and  long-term infection with this organism has been associated with gastric mucosal  atrophy and serious long-term complications, such as gastric lymphoma and  adenocarcinoma. Three hundred patients diagnosed with gastritis between January 2008  and April 2010 were included in our study. The computerized medical database of  these patients was reviewed retrospectively in order to assess whether the type of  gastritis diagnosed (H. pylori vs non-H. pylori gastritis) is influenced by PPI  exposure. H. pylori density was graded as low, if corresponding to mild density  following the Updated Sydney System, or high, if corresponding to moderate or severe  densities in the Updated Sydney System. RESULTS: Patients were equally distributed  between males and females with a median age at the time of diagnosis of 50 years old  (range: 20-87). The histological types of gastritis were classified as H. pylori  gastritis (n = 156, 52%) and non-H. pylori gastritis (n = 144, 48%). All patients  with non-H. pylori gastritis had inactive chronic gastritis. Patients with no  previous PPI exposure were more likely to be diagnosed with H. pylori gastritis than  those with previous PPI exposure (71% vs 34.2%, P < 0.001). Intestinal metaplasia  was more likely to be detected in the latter patients (1.4% vs 6.5%, P = 0.023).  Multivariate analysis has also demonstrated that in the presence of previous PPI  exposure (OR = 0.217, 95%CI: 0.123-0.385), GERD (OR = 0.317, 95%CI: 0.132-0.763, P =  0.01), alcohol intake (OR = 0.396, 95%CI: 0.195-0.804, P = 0.01), the detection of  H. pylori was less likely. Chronic use of PPIs may mask H. pylori infections  promoting the diagnosis of non-H. pylori gastritis and leads to a significant drop  in H. pylori densities and to an increased risk of intestinal metaplasia.  CONCLUSION: The use of PPIs masks H. pylori infection, promotes the diagnosis of  non-H. pylori inactive chronic gastritis diagnosis, and increases the incidence of  intestinal metaplasia.FAU - Nasser, Soumana CAU - Nasser SCAD - Soumana C Nasser, Jeanette G Nassif, School of Pharmacy, Lebanese American  University, P.O.

However, few specific recommendations on  second-line agents are provided. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to  describe antidiabetic treatment patterns in Medicare Advantage patients with T2DM  within 6 months of measurement of the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level.  RESEARCH DESIGN: This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized medical,  pharmacy, and laboratory claims from a large Medicare Advantage with Prescription  Drug (MAPD) coverage payer. MAPD members between 65 and 89 years old identified as  having T2DM between 2009 and 2011 were eligible for inclusion. A 12-month baseline  period before the first HbA1c value (index date) was evaluated for demographic and  clinical differences. Antidiabetic therapy was evaluated for 6 months post-index.  The study population was stratified into three cohorts based on index HbA1c value:  controlled (<8%, 64 mmoL/mol), uncontrolled (≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol and <10%, 86  mmoL/mol), and severely uncontrolled (≥ 10%, 86 mmoL/mol). RESULTS: Despite elevated  HbA1c values (≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol), 7-8% of patients did not receive antidiabetic  therapy during the post-index period. Metformin and sulfonylureas were the oral  antidiabetics (OADs) most frequently used as monotherapy. The majority of patients  on combination therapy were on two or more OADs and higher injectable use was  observed in the severely uncontrolled cohort. Metformin was included in >60% of the  combination regimens with metformin + sulfonylurea being the most common.  CONCLUSION: This study suggests suboptimal treatment of those not in glycemic  control (HbA1c ≥ 8%, 64 mmoL/mol).

METHODS: A retrospective cohort  study was done using health administrative databases in Saskatchewan. Eligible  patients were newly admitted to LTCF in Saskatchewan between 2003 and 2011 and  maintained LTCF residency for at least 6xa0months. Prevalence of diabetes was defined  with physician or hospital claims in the 2xa0years preceding admission.  Antihyperglycemic medication use was estimated from prescription claims data during  the first 6xa0months after LTCF admission. All data were descriptively analyzed.  RESULTS: The validated case definition for diabetes (≥2 diagnostic claims) in the  2xa0years before or 6xa0months after admission was met by 16.9% of patients (2471 of  14,624). An additional 965 patients (6.6%) had a single diabetes diagnostic claim or  antihyperglycemic prescriptions only.

METHODS: We identified 2925 new  users of metformin with type 2 diabetes between 2005 and 2012 in the electronic  health records of an integrated health system in Northern California. Patients were  matched 1:1 on the propensity for receiving early treatment (defined as ≤6 months  from first evidence of diabetes). We evaluated the effectiveness of early versus  delayed metformin treatment on intermediate clinical outcomes indicated by changes  in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI), as well as the incidence of  therapy intensification (addition or substitution of a second antihyperglycemic  agent). RESULTS: A total of 2144 propensity-score matched patients were included in  the early or delayed treatment group (n=1072, in each). Early treatment was  associated with significantly larger decreases in HbA1c (-0.36%; 95% confidence  intervals [CI]: -0.44 to -0.27%; P<0.001) and BMI (-0.46 kg/m(2); 95% CI: -0.64 to  -0.29 kg/m(2); P<0.001) relative to delayed treatment.

A time-dependent  approach was used to calculate ovarian cancer incidence and estimate hazard ratios  by Cox regression for never-users (as referent group), ever-users and subgroups of  metformin exposure (tertiles of cumulative duration and cumulative dose). RESULTS:  During follow-up, 601 metformin ever-users and 2600 never-users developed ovarian  cancer, representing an incidence of 49.4 and 146.4 per 100,000 person-years,  respectively. The overall fully adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) for  ever-users versus never-users was 0.658 (0.593-0.730). The fully adjusted hazard  ratios for the first, second and third tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin  therapy were 1.169 (1.019-1.341), 0.761 (0.644-0.898) and 0.276 (0.225-0.340),  respectively (p trendu2009<u20090.01) and 1.220 (1.067-1.395), 0.610 (0.513-0.725) and 0.305  (0.248-0.374), respectively (p trendu2009<u20090.01), for a cumulative dose of metformin. In  additional analyses, sulfonylureas but not the other antidiabetic drugs were  associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer.

This study examines how adherence and  persistence to once-daily liraglutide impact glycemic control and economic outcomes  in a real-world population of adult type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. METHODS: A  retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data from July 2009 through  September 2013. Patients aged ≥18 years with T2D treated with liraglutide were  identified (index date = first liraglutide prescription). Adherence was based on the  proportion of days covered (PDC); with PDC ≥0.80 classified as adherent.  Non-persistent patients were those with a gap in therapy of >90 days. Lab results  for glycated hemoglobin (A1C) were used to identify whether patients achieved target  levels of <7.0% and ≤ 6.5%, or experienced a reduction of ≥1.0% in A1C from  pre-index (baseline) to post-index (follow-up). Logistic regression was used to  estimate the likelihood of achieving the A1C goals, adjusted for baseline  characteristics. Diabetes-related medical, pharmacy, and total costs were modeled  and estimated for the adherence and persistence cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 1321  patients were identified. The mean PDC was 0.59 and 34% of patients were classified  as adherent, while 60% were persistent over 12 months of follow-up. Adherent and  persistent patients were more likely to achieve each of the A1C goals than their  non-adherent and non-persistent counterparts after adjusting for patient  characteristics. Adherence and persistence were associated with higher adjusted  diabetes-related pharmacy and total healthcare costs during follow-up; whereas  persistent patients had significantly lower diabetes-related medical costs than  non-persistent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence and persistence to liraglutide are  associated with improved A1C outcomes. Persistent patients showed significantly  lower medical costs versus those discontinuing liraglutide.

Although metabolic adverse effects have been linked to SGA use in  youths, estimating the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, a rarer outcome, has been  challenging. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether SGA initiation was associated with an  increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary analyses examined  the risk associated with multiple-drug regimens, including stimulants and  antidepressants, as well as individual SGAs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  Retrospective national cohort study of Medicaid-enrolled youths between January 2003  and December 2007. In this observational study using national Medicaid Analytic  eXtract data files, initiators and noninitiators of SGAs were identified in each  month. Included in this study were US youths aged 10 to 18 years with a mental  health diagnosis and enrolled in a Medicaid fee-for-service arrangement during the  study. Those with chronic steroid exposure, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or SGA  use during a 1-year look-back period were ineligible. The mean follow-up time for  all participants was 17.2 months. Youths were followed up until diagnosis of  diabetes mellitus or end of follow-up owing to censoring caused by the transition  into a Medicaid managed care arrangement or Medicaid ineligibility (the end of  available data). Propensity weights were developed to balance observed demographic  and clinical characteristics between exposure groups. Discrete failure time models  were fitted using weighted logistic regression to estimate the risk for incident  diabetes mellitus between initiators and noninitiators. EXPOSURE: A filled SGA  prescription. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident type 2 diabetes mellitus  identified through visit and pharmacy claims during the observation period. RESULTS:  Among 107,551 SGA initiators and 1,221,434 noninitiators, the risk for incident  diabetes mellitus was increased among initiators (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% CI,  1.35-1.69; Pu2009<u2009.001).

The outcome was  ischemic stroke within 30days postoperatively and verified with computed tomography  (CT) in patients with new postoperative atrial fibrillation for more than 48h.  RESULTS: New, postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 403 (17.8%) of the  patients and 191 of those (47.4%) were not started on warfarin at 48hours. Eight  patients developed CT-verified ischemic stroke, which occurred on postoperative day  1-3 in 4 patients and in 3 patients was of the lacunar type.

We also aimed to explore the effects of neighborhood deprivation on  the relationship between CHADS2 risk score and warfarin prescription. METHODS: Data  were obtained from primary health care records that contained individual clinical  data that were linked to national data on neighborhood of residence and a  deprivation index for different neighborhoods. Logistic regression was used to  estimate the potential neighborhood differences in prescribed warfarin, aspirin and  statins, and the association between the CHADS2 score and prescribed warfarin  treatment, in neighborhoods with high, middle (referent) and low socio-economic  (SES). RESULTS: After adjustment for age, socio-economic factors, co-morbidities and  moves to neighborhoods with different SES during follow-up, adults with AF living in  high SES neighborhoods were more often prescribed warfarin (men odds ratio (OR) (95%  confidence interval (CI): 1.44 (1.27-1.62); and women OR (95% CI): 1.19 (1.05-1.36))  and statins (men OR (95% CI): 1.23 (1.07-1.41); women OR (95% CI): 1.23 (1.05-1.44))  compared to their counterparts residing in middle SES.

METHODS: Adults who initiated hypertension  treatment with a beta blocker were identified from the MarketScan * claims database  (2008-2012). Patients were classified based on their first beta blocker use:  nebivolol, atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and other beta blockers. Patients with  compelling indications for atenolol, carvedilol or metoprolol (acute coronary  syndrome and congestive heart failure) were excluded. Patients enrolled in health  maintenance organization or capitated point of service insurance plans were also  excluded. Persistence was defined as continuous use of the index drug (<60 day gap).  The average effect of persistence on medical costs (2012 USD) was estimated using  generalized linear models (GLMs). Regression estimates were used to predict medical  cost differences associated with persistence between nebivolol and the other  cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 587,424 hypertensive patients met the inclusion  criteria. Each additional month of persistence with any one beta blocker was  associated with $152.51 in all-cause medical cost savings; continuous treatment for  1 year was associated with $1585.98 in all-cause medical cost savings. Patients  treated with nebivolol had longer persistence during the 1 year study period  (median: 315 days) than all other beta blockers (median: 156-292 days). Longer  persistence with nebivolol translated into $305.74 all-cause medical cost savings  relative to all other beta blockers.

PEDs were suggestive of type 1 CNV in 10 eyes, but no  other signs of AMD, specifically no drusen, were present. In the remaining 43 eyes,  flat irregular PEDs were stable over time (mean follow-up duration: 15 years) with  no evidence of active neovascularization. CONCLUSION: Although the possible  occurrence of type 1 CNV complicating the course of chronic CSC should not be  ignored, all cases of flat irregular PED should not be mistaken for active CNV and  systematically treated with anti-VEGF. Nevertheless, in some cases with worsened  vision not responding to usual CSC therapy, anti-VEGF could be considered as a  therapeutic test to rule out the presence of secondary CNV.', NULL, NULL);

Few studies have  estimated the association between real-world natalizumab persistence behavior and  relapse-related outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To (a) examine the impact of using natalizumab  consistently (i.e., persistent) on relapse-related outcomes as compared with  transitioning to inconsistent natalizumab use (i.e., nonpersistent) and (b) examine  the impact of other treatment patterns on relapse-related outcomes for those who  initiated natalizumab. METHODS: Using the IMS PharMetrics Plus claims database  (years 2006-2012), we identified MS subjects who initiated natalizumab (no  natalizumab claims in year prior) and had at least 2 years of follow-up. Persistence  in annual follow-up periods was defined as no 90-day or greater gap in natalizumab  therapy. Relapse was an MS-related hospitalization or outpatient visit with  intravenous or oral steroid burst claim within 7 days. Analyses compared  observations based on changes in natalizumab persistence and natalizumab  nonpersistence status from 1 year to the next (e.g., transitioning from persistent  to nonpersistent), estimating differences in mean annual relapses and mean annual  relapse-related costs. RESULTS: A total of 2,407 natalizumab initiators had at least  2 years of follow-up, yielding 4,770 year-to-year natalizumab treatment patterns  where each subject contributed 1, 2, or 3 year-to-year treatment patterns. In the  year prior, 3,187 treatment patterns were persistent; 731 (22.9%) of these  transitioned to nonpersistence. The remaining 1,583 treatment patterns were  nonpersistent in the year prior; 132 (8.3%) of these transitioned to persistence.  Persistent to nonpersistent treatment patterns were associated with a mean  relapse-rate increase of 0.23 (95% CIu2009=u20090.12, 0.35), and a mean increase in  relapse-related costs of $1,346 (95% CIu2009=u2009$97, $2,595). Nonpersistent to persistent  treatment patterns were associated with a mean relapse-rate decrease of -0.15 (95%  CIu2009=u2009-0.32, 0.017) and a mean decrease in relapse-related costs of -$1,369 (95%  CIu2009=u2009-$2,761, $23).

Antiepileptic prophylaxis reduces early seizures, but their use beyond  1u2005week does not prevent the development of post-traumatic epilepsy. Furthermore,  prolonged prophylaxis exposes patients to side effects of the drugs and has  occupational implications. The American Academy of Neurology recommends that  antiepileptic prophylaxis should be started for patients with severe traumatic brain  injury and discontinued after 1u2005week. An audit is presented here that investigates  the use of prophylaxis in a cohort of military patients admitted to the UK Defence  Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC). METHODS: Data were collected and analysed  retrospectively from electronic and paper records between February 2009 and August  2012. The timing and duration of antiepileptic drug use and the incidence of  seizures were recorded. RESULTS: During the study period, 52 patients with severe  traumatic brain injury were admitted to the rehabilitation centre: 25 patients (48%)  were commenced on prophylaxis during the first week following injury while 27 (52%)  did not receive prophylaxis. Only one patient (2%) received prophylaxis for the  recommended period of 1u2005week, 22 patients (42%) received prophylaxis for longer than  1u2005week with a mean duration of 6.2u2005months. Two patients (4%) had post-traumatic  epilepsy and started on treatment at DMRC. CONCLUSIONS: The use of antiepileptic  prophylaxis varies widely and is generally inconsistent with evidence-based  guidance.

However, there have been  relatively few studies with children and adolescents. Also, an appropriate dosage  has yet to be determined. AIM: This study investigated the safety and the efficacy  of levetiracetam for intravenous treatment of convulsive status epilepticus and  acute repetitive seizures in children and adolescents. METHOD: Retrospectively, the  study reviewed the medical records of 19 male and 31 female patients under 18 years  of age who had received intravenous levetiracetam treatment either for acute  repetitive seizures or for convulsive status epilepticus. The patients were admitted  between April 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2011 to the Department of Pediatrics,  Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.  Data were collected on underlying illnesses, etiology of seizures, indication for  levetiracetam therapy, initial dosage, rate of infusion, untoward effects during  infusion and emerged complications. Efficacy of treatment was defined as the  termination of seizure within 30 min of completing levetiracetam infusion and no  seizure recurrence within 6 h of initial treatment. RESULTS: The age range of the 50  patients was from one day to 18 years (mean 79.6 months). The analysis included 52  episodes of 34 acute repetitive seizures (63.4%) and 18 convulsive status  epilepticus (34.6%). Infusion rates ranged from 2 to 66 mg/kg/min (mean 29.6).

The  eyes were classified by the presence or absence of the track lines in the SD OCT  images after the resolution of macular edema. The correlation between the presence  of the track lines and the integrity of the photoreceptors was determined. RESULTS:  Twenty-one of 59 (36%) eyes had track lines in the SD OCT images after a resolution  of the macular edema during the follow-up period.

METHODS: We reviewed the  records of 535 IV-rtPA-treated patients who presented to our primary stroke centers.  The diagnosis of SM or transient ischemic attack (TIA) was based on patient  presentation, hospital course, electroencephalography, and negative neuroimaging  studies. The excess cost analysis compared actual direct and indirect hospital costs  of a patient to what their direct and indirect hospital costs would have been had  they primarily been diagnosed with mimic or TIA. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients  post-IV-rtPA treatment had final diagnosis of SM; 21 had TIAs. The excess direct and  indirect hospital costs for mimics were $257,975 and $152,813, respectively. The  median excess cost was $5401 per admission. The excess total cost for TIAs was  $85,026 with a median of $3407 per admission.

RESULTS: Among a total of 71,584  patients, 24,668 patients were on risperidone, 15,860 patients on quetiapine, 3,888  patients on olanzapine, 19,564 patients on haloperidol, and 7,604 patients on  chlorpromazine. A substantially higher risk was observed with chlorpromazine (HR =  3.47, 95% CI, 1.97-5.38), which was followed by haloperidol (HR = 2.43, 95% CI,  1.18-3.14), quetiapine (HR = 1.23, 95% CI, 0.78-2.12), and olanzapine (HR = 1.12,  95% CI, 0.59-2.75). Patients who were prescribed chlorpromazine for longer than 150  days showed a higher risk (HR = 3.60, 95% CI, 1.83-6.02) than those who took it for  a shorter period of time. CONCLUSIONS: A much greater risk of ischemic stroke was  observed in patients who used chlorpromazine and haloperidol compared to  risperidone. The evidence suggested that there is a strong need to exercise caution  while prescribing these agents to the elderly in light of severe adverse events with  atypical antipsychotics.FAU - Shin, Ju-YoungAU - Shin JYAD - Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management, Seoul, Republic of Korea.FAU - Choi, Nam-KyongAU - Choi NKAD - Medical Research Collaborating Center, Seoul National University College of  Medicine/ Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.FAU - Lee, JoongyubAU - Lee JAD - Medical Research Collaborating Center, Seoul National University College of  Medicine/ Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.FAU - Seong, Jong-MiAU - Seong JMAD - Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management, Seoul, Republic of Korea.FAU - Park, Mi-JuAU - Park MJAD - Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management, Seoul, Republic of Korea.FAU - Lee, Shin HaengAU - Lee SHAD - Korea Institute of Drug Safety and Risk Management, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', NULL, NULL);

The Functional Ambulatory Scale was used to assess motor functional  status, and the Turkish-validated version of the minimental state examination test  was used to assess cognitive status. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found  between 25(OH)D level and cognitive impairment among patients who had ischemic  strokes. High levels of 25(OH)D were associated with greater functional gain during  the rehabilitation program in both ischemic stroke patients and hemorrhagic stroke  patients.

METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology,  and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database was used to characterize presentation,  treatment, and survival patterns in patients with DLBCL who were diagnosed between  2002 and 2009. Chi-square tests compared characteristics and initial treatments  among patients with DLBCL who were aged >80 years and ≤80 years. Multivariable  logistic regression models examined factors associated with treatment selection in  patients aged >80 years; standard and propensity score-adjusted multivariable Cox  proportional hazards models examined relationships between treatment regimen,  treatment duration, and survival. RESULTS: Among 4635 patients with DLBCL, 1156  (25%) were aged >80 years. Patients aged >80 years were less likely to receive  R-CHOP and more likely to be observed or receive the combination of rituximab,  cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (P<.0001 for both).

Evidence-based guidance is  limited for the appropriate administration of Crotalinae Polyvalent Immune Fab  (FabAV) and the duration of laboratory follow-up. The objective of our study was to  assess the incidence of marked and recurrent envenomation coagulopathy at our trauma  center and identify practice patterns that may prevent serious complications.  METHODS: A retrospective case review was conducted over a 3-year period on patients  treated for symptomatic snakebite injury. Case records were reviewed for the  inclusion criteria of international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 2.0. The  exclusion criterion was limited to patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.  RESULTS: In all, 61 patients were identified on retrospective chart review and 3  patients (4.9%) met inclusion criteria.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the  demographic characteristics, response to treatments, and outcomes of a cohort of  patients who developed immune cytopenias following SOT. PROCEDURE: In this single  center retrospective review, patients with immune cytopenias after SOT were  identified by electronic medical record (EMR) search and transplant databases from  1995-2012. RESULTS: Of 764 SOT patients, 19 (2.4%) developed immune cytopenias.  Incidence varied widely by transplant type from 1.2% (renal) to 23.5%  (multivisceral). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) was the most common immune  cytopenia. Overall median time from transplant to immune cytopenia was 8u2009m and  varied by transplant type from 3u2009m (liver) to 74u2009m (heart). Standard therapies for  immune cytopenias were often used and ineffective. The most effective therapy for  the immune cytopenia was changing immunosuppression from tacrolimus to another  agent. Three of 19 patients died; none directly attributed to the immune cytopenia.  CONCLUSIONS: Immune cytopenias are not rare after SOT, and patients usually do not  respond well to traditional first line therapies.

Cerebral vasospasm is a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage that  contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. Nimodipine has been used in  adults to reduce the incidence of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage  and improve long-term outcomes. There are, however, no data in children. METHODS:  Records of children with a confirmed diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage who  received nimodipine between January 1, 2005 and August 31, 2013 were reviewed.  Dosing of nimodipine and associated hypotensive events were recorded. Transcranial  Doppler ultrasonography, cranial computerized tomography, and angiography were  followed as a measure of cerebral vasospasm, rebleeding, and subsequent infarction.  RESULTS: Twelve children (average age 11.8 ± 3.3 years, age range 3.5 to 17.3 years)  were included. Aneurysm was responsible for the highest percentage (41.7%) of  subarachnoid hemorrhage events. The mean dose of oral nimodipine was 1 mg/kg every 4  hours and was associated with a high rate of hypotension requiring intervention or  dose modification. Clinical outcomes while on nimodipine therapy varied; evidence of  vasospasm was observed in 67%, new infarction in 33%, and rebleeding in 17%.  Functional and cognitive deficits were minor in two-thirds and absent in the  remaining individuals. All patients survived until hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS:  Oral nimodipine after subarachnoid hemorrhage in children does not eliminate  vasospasm, rebleeding, or infarction and is associated with significant hypotension.  Nevertheless, clinical outcomes appear favorable relative to the adult population  who receive nimodipine. Further study, with dose titration, is warranted.', NULL, NULL);

This US claims analysis evaluated, from  a US health plan perspective, patterns of total direct costs of care from treatment  initiation to progression for patients with MM treated with novel agents, using time  to next therapy (TTNT) as a proxy measure for progression. METHODS: A retrospective  study was conducted using a large US claims database, evaluating patients with  claims for MM between 2006 and 2013. Patients with claims for stem cell transplant  (SCT) were excluded. The analysis focused on patients receiving lenalidomide (LEN)  or bortezomib (BORT) based treatment, for whom complete claim history was available  through initiation of subsequent treatment. Average patient monthly direct costs  were determined, including medical and pharmacy costs, and total cost patterns over  quarterly time periods were calculated. RESULTS: The study population comprised 2843  patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) and 1361 with relapsed MM. Total monthly  cost for patients with NDMM declined steadily, from $15,734 initially to $5082 at  18+ months after therapy. Upon initiation of second-line therapy, total monthly  costs rose to $13,876 and declined to $6446 18 months later. Although NDMM cost  levels for individual ordinal months were similar between the LEN and BORT groups,  TTNT was longer for LEN-based treatments (37 months). The BORT-treated cohort had  higher average monthly total costs for NDMM and for the common time period through  37 months after initiation of therapy ($7534 vs $10,763 for LEN and BORT,  respectively). Key limitations of this study, in addition to the lack of mortality  and staging information available from claims data, include the definition of TTNT  based on change in treatment or a defined gap in therapy prior to retreatment, which  may differ from actual time of progression in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: For  patients with NDMM receiving either LEN- or BORT-based treatment without SCT,  followed until TTNT, total direct monthly costs (drugu2009+u2009medical) declined steadily  over time. Monthly costs returned to near initial levels when patients began  second-line therapy and then followed a similar pattern of decline. Due to the  longer TTNT for patients initiated on LEN and the associated longer period of  below-average costs, patients initiated with LEN-based treatments had mean monthly  total costs >$3200 lower than total costs for patients initiated on BORT during the  first 3 years after starting treatment, cumulating to nearly $120,000 in lower costs  for patients initiated on LEN.FAU - Arikian, Steven RAU - Arikian SRAD - Genesis Research , Hoboken, NJ , USA.FAU - Milentijevic, DejanAU - Milentijevic DFAU - Binder, GaryAU - Binder GFAU - Gibson, Craig JAU - Gibson CJFAU - Hu, X HenryAU - Hu XHFAU - Nagarwala, YasirAU - Nagarwala YFAU - Hussein, MohamadAU - Hussein MFAU - Corvino, Frank AAU - Corvino FAFAU - Surinach, AndyAU - Surinach A', NULL, NULL);

Identifying and addressing barriers to immunisation may lead to improved  immunisation rates. Immunisation and newborn vitamin K prophylaxis have many  similarities. We aimed to investigate whether parents who decline newborn vitamin K  are also more likely to decline subsequent childhood immunisations. METHODS: We  undertook a retrospective cohort study, examining the relationship between vitamin K  administration and immunisation uptake by parents of babies born over a 2-year  period (January 2010-December 2011) in Dunedin, New Zealand (NZ). Both written and  electronic data from a single birthing unit and the NZ National Immunisation  Register (NIR) were analysed to ascertain the relationship between declining newborn  vitamin K prophylaxis and subsequent immunisation uptake. RESULTS: Records for 3575  babies were examined. Ninety-two per cent of infants received intramuscular, and 5%  received oral vitamin K. An increased risk ratio for non-immunisation of 14.1 (95%  confidence interval 7.8-25.9) for babies whose parents declined vitamin K was  identified. Receiving oral vitamin K was also associated with subsequent  non-immunisation, with a risk ratio of 3.5 (95% confidence interval 1.7-7.3).  CONCLUSIONS: Parents who decline newborn vitamin K are more likely to decline  immunisation for their child. These parents, as well as those that elect for oral  vitamin K, are a small but easily identifiable group to whom additional education  about the benefits of immunisation could be offered.

However, in-hospital recording  of confounders is limited, and incorporating linked healthcare claims data available  for a subset of the cohort may improve confounding control. We investigated methods  capable of adjusting for confounders measured in a subset, including complete case  analysis, multiple imputation of missing data, and propensity score (PS)  calibration. METHODS: Methods were implemented in an example study of adults in  Premier undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 2004-2008 and exposed  to either bivalirudin or heparin. In a subset of patients enrolled in UnitedHealth  for at least 90xa0days before hospitalization, additional confounders were assessed  from healthcare claims, including comorbidities, prior medication use, and service  use intensity. Diagnostics for each method were evaluated, and methods were compared  with respect to the estimates and confidence intervals of treatment effects on  repeat PCI, bleeding, and in-hospital death. RESULTS: Of 210,268 patients in the  hospital-based cohort, 3240 (1.5xa0%) had linked healthcare claims. This subset was  younger and healthier than the overall study population. The linked subset was too  small for complete case evaluation of two of the three outcomes of interest.  Multiple imputation and PS calibration did not meaningfully impact treatment effect  estimates and associated confidence intervals.

However, to date,  there are no published long-term clinical data on the cost-effectiveness of  trabeculectomy with mitomycin vs tube insertion. OBJECTIVE: To assess the  cost-effectiveness of these procedures compared with maximal medical treatment.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the Markov cohort model with a 5-year  time horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 patients who required  glaucoma surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)  gained, costs from the societal perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio of medical treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion. Costs were  identified from Medicare Current Procedural Terminology and Ambulatory Payment  Classification reimbursement codes and Red Book medication costs. The QALYs were  based on visual field and visual acuity outcomes. The hypothetical societal limit to  resources was included using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY.  Costs and utilities were discounted at 3% per year. Uncertainty was assessed using  deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The mean costs for medical treatment,  trabeculectomy, and tube insertion were $6172, $7872 and $10 075, respectively;  these amounts resulted in a cost difference of $1700 (95% CI, $1644-$1770) for  medical treatment vs trabeculectomy, $3904 (95% CI, $3858-$3953) for medical  treatment vs tube insertion, and $2203 (95% CI, $2121-$2261) for trabeculectomy vs  tube insertion. The mean 5-year probability of blindness was 4% for both surgical  procedures and 15% for medical treatment. The utility gained after medical  treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion was 3.10, 3.30, and 3.38 QALYs,  respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $8289 per QALY for  trabeculectomy vs medical treatment, $13 896 per QALY for tube insertion vs medical  treatment, and $29 055 per QALY for tube insertion vs trabeculectomy. The  cost-effectiveness of each surgical procedure was most sensitive to early and late  surgical failure rates and was minimally affected by adverse events, rates of visual  field progression, or medication costs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assuming a  willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY, trabeculectomy and tube insertion are  cost-effective compared with medical treatment alone. Trabeculectomy, however, is  cost-effective at a substantially lower cost per QALY compared with tube insertion.

People living with HIV have a 5% to 10% annual risk of developing active  tuberculosis (TB) once infected with TB bacilli, compared to a 5% lifetime risk in  HIV-negative people with latent TB infection. Moreover, people living with HIV have  a 20-fold higher risk of dying from TB. A growing body of literature suggests that  IPT reduces overall TB incidence and is therefore of considerable benefit to  patients and the larger community. However, in 2009, of the estimated 33 million  people living with HIV, only 1.7 million (5%) were screened for TB, and about 85,000  (0.2%) were offered IPT. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will examine the use of clinical  decision-support reminders to improve rates of initiation of preventative treatment  in a TB/HIV co-morbid population living in a TB endemic area. This will be a  pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster-randomized superiority trial with a 1:1  allocation to treatment ratio.

All HIV-positive adult patients who complete an initial  encounter at a study cluster and at least one return encounter during the study  period will be included in the study cohort. The primary endpoint will be IPT  prescription at 3 months post the initial encounter. We will conduct both  individual-level and cluster-level analyses. Due to the nature of the intervention,  the trial will not be blinded. This study will contribute to the growing evidence  base for the use of electronic health interventions in low-resource settings to  promote high-quality clinical care, health system optimization and positive patient  outcomes.

Dialysis facilities could either adopt  the bundle completely (100%) in the first year of launch, or phase-in (25%) over  four years. Differences in practice patterns and patient outcomes were hypothesized  to occur in facilities that phased-in 25% compared to those that did not. METHODS:  Data are from STEPPS, a study of 51 small dialysis organization facilities designed  to describe trends in dialytic treatment before and after bundle implementation.  Baseline was defined as October-December 2010; follow-up as January-December 2011.  Facility- and patient-level data were collected at enrollment and regularly  thereafter. Cox proportional hazards and linear multi-level models were used to  estimate the effect of opting-in 25% (vs. 100%) on practice patterns and clinical  outcomes. RESULTS: 12 facilities (patient n = 346) opted-in 25% and 37 facilities  (patient n = 1296) opted-in 100% to the dialysis bundle. At baseline, patients at  25% facilities were primarily covered by Medicare, were more likely to be black, and  were receiving higher monthly epoetin alfa (EPO) doses.

Standard  antidepressant medications do not work rapidly enough in this setting. Evidence  suggests that ketamine rapidly treats treatment refractory depression in the general  population. Ketamine׳s role for treating depression in the hospice population  warrants further study. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review of 31  inpatients receiving hospice care who received ketamine for depression on a clinical  basis was conducted. The primary outcome measure was the Clinical Global Impression  Scale, which was used retrospectively to rate subjects׳ therapeutic improvement,  global improvement, and side effects from ketamine over 21 days. Additionally, time  to onset of therapeutic effect was analyzed. RESULTS: Using the Clinical Global  Impression Scale, ketamine was found to be significantly therapeutically effective  through the first week after ketamine dosing (p < 0.05), with 93% of patients  showing positive results for days 0-3 and 80% for days 4-7 following ketamine  dosing. Patients experienced global improvement during all 4 studied time periods  following ketamine dosing (p < 0.05). Significantly more patients had either no side  effects or side effects that did not significantly impair functioning at each of the  4 assessed time periods following ketamine dosing (p < 0.05). Additionally,  significantly more patients experienced their first therapeutic response during days  0-1 following ketamine dosing (p < 0.001) than during any other time period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by  our institutional review board and is HIPAA-compliant. We retrospectively evaluated  consecutive CTPA studies performed with a test bolus technique in a 2-year period. A  time-density curve was derived from each test bolus. For comparison, left  ventricular (LV) and RV dimensions (area, diameter) and PE load score (Qanadli  method) were measured using CT data. A cardiologist blinded to the clinical and  other imaging data reviewed a subset of the corresponding echocardiographic images  to assess for RV dysfunction. Demographic data, mode of treatment, and patient  outcome information were gathered using electronic medical records. Test bolus and  anatomic data were correlated with PE-related mortality. RESULTS: A total of 71  patients (34 men and 37 women, average age 54.4 y) who had a CTPA performed using a  test bolus technique were diagnosed with acute PE. Factors that significantly  correlated with PE-related mortality on univariate analysis were: age above 60 years  (odds ratio 19.1, P = 0.05), RV/LV diameter >1.5 (odds ratio 48.8, P < 0.001), RV/LV  area >1 (odds ratio 8.6, P = 0.06), bolus curve upslope time >6 seconds (odds ratio  23.3, P = 0.04), 50% downslope time >6 seconds (odds ratio 20, P = 0.01), and  embolus load score >15 (odds ratio 25, P = 0.03).

The objective of this study was to compare the rate of hospitalization in  patients treated with rivaroxaban after its introduction with what it would have  been before the introduction of rivaroxaban. METHODS: A retrospective claims  analysis was conducted using the MarketScan Hospital Drug Database from January 2011  to December 2013. Adult patients with a primary diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis  (DVT) treated with rivaroxaban or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridged to  warfarin during the first day of an evaluation at a hospital were identified. Based  on propensity-score methods, historical LMWH/warfarin patients (i.e., patients who  received LMWH/warfarin before the approval of rivaroxaban) were matched 4:1 to  rivaroxaban patients, and the rates of hospitalization were compared. RESULTS: All  rivaroxaban-treated patients (n = 134) in the database were well matched with four  historical LMWH/warfarin-treated patients (n = 536). Among the rivaroxaban cohort,  60% of the patients were admitted to the hospital, compared to 82% of the historical  patients treated with LMWH/warfarin in the matched cohort.

However, there are limited data on the  effectiveness of glyburide when compared with insulin as used in a real-world  setting. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes  in women with GDM treated with glyburide compared with insulin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of a population-based cohort from a  nationwide US employer-based insurance claims database from January 1, 2000, to  December 31, 2011. We identified women with GDM and their newborns. We excluded  those with type 1 or 2 diabetes and those younger than 15 years or older than 45  years. EXPOSURES: Treatment with glyburide or insulin during pregnancy within 150  days before delivery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used binomial regression to  estimate risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences with 95% confidence intervals for  the association of glyburide with diagnosis codes for obstetric trauma, cesarean  delivery, birth injury, preterm birth, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, jaundice,  large for gestational age, and hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit.  Inverse probability of treatment weights were used to adjust for maternal  characteristics that differed between the treatment groups. RESULTS: Among 110,879  women with GDM, 9173 women (8.3%) were treated with glyburide (nu2009=u20094982) or insulin  (nu2009=u20094191). After adjusting for differences at baseline, newborns of women treated  with glyburide were at increased risk for neonatal intensive care unit admission  (RRu2009=u20091.41; 95% CI, 1.23-1.62), respiratory distress (RRu2009=u20091.63; 95% CI, 1.23-2.15),  hypoglycemia (RRu2009=u20091.40; 95% CI, 1.00-1.95), birth injury (RRu2009=u20091.35; 95% CI,  1.00-1.82), and large for gestational age (RRu2009=u20091.43; 95% CI, 1.16-1.76) compared  with those treated with insulin; they were not at increased risk for obstetric  trauma (RRu2009=u20090.92; 95% CI, 0.71-1.20), preterm birth (RRu2009=u20091.06; 95% CI, 0.93-1.21),  or jaundice (RRu2009=u20090.96; 95% CI, 0.48-1.91). The risk of cesarean delivery was 3%  lower in the glyburide group (adjusted RRu2009=u20090.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00).

It is currently unclear how often appropriate medication selection  and dosage adjustment occurs in practice. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate  the extent of potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) (the use of a  contraindicated medication or inappropriately high dose according to the renal  function) in patients with renal impairment from admission through to discharge from  the Royal Hobart Hospital (RHH), Tasmania, Australia; to evaluate the medications  most commonly implicated in PIP; and the factors associated with PIP in renal  impairment. METHODS: Medical records of 251 patients consecutively admitted to the  RHH aged 40 years and above, with a creatinine clearance of ≤60u2009mL/min, and  hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus in their medical history, were reviewed. PIP  was assessed using the Australian Medicines Handbook and/or product information.  RESULTS: Of the 251 patients, 81 (32.3%) were receiving a total of 116 potentially  inappropriate medications (PIMs) at the time of admission. The number of patients  receiving PIMs (81 vs. 44, p<0.001 chi-square test) as well as the total number of  PIMs (116 vs. 63, p<0.001 Wilcoxon signed rank test) were significantly decreased at  discharge. Metformin was the most common PIM at admission. However, PIP of metformin  was reduced by approximately 50% by discharge. Logistic regression analysis revealed  two significant independent risk factors for PIP: a higher number of medications at  admission increased risk of PIP (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.02-1.18, p=0.010), and higher  initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased the risk of PIP (OR  0.9, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of lack of  body weight documentation and lack of clear guidelines for dosage adjustment based  on the eGFR, PIP in patients with renal impairment is common and admission to the  hospital was associated with a significant reduction in PIP.

OBJECTIVES: To (a) compare total costs of HCRU  and adverse events (AEs) in patients with advanced RCC receiving first-line  pazopanib or sunitinib from the phase III clinical trial and (b) perform a post hoc  economic analysis that applied direct medical care and pharmacy unit costs, obtained  from the Truven Health MarketScan Databases, to HCRU and AE rates. METHODS: Total  HCRU costs included components for provider contacts, diagnostics, hospitalizations,  procedures, and study/nonstudy drugs. Patients were stratified by the presence or  absence of an AE in order to estimate costs attributable to AEs. Costs were adjusted  to 2013 U.S. dollars.

METHODS: New users of  antidiabetic agents were identified with a 1-year washout period between January 1,  1995, and December 31, 2005, in Saskatchewan, Canada, and were followed until  December 31, 2008. Within this population-based cohort, persons were classified as  users of benefit or non-benefit thiazolidinediones (TZDs) according to their first  prescription record between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2006 (non-benefit  prescription records were not captured before 2006). An intention-to-treat approach  was used to categorize TZD exposure over time. We evaluated the potential bias  introduced by drug exposure misclassification by evaluating bootstrapped differences  in hazard ratio (HR) estimates of all-cause hospitalization or death between users  and nonusers of TZDs obtained from analyses that contained complete drug use  (non-benefit and benefit drug use) versus benefit drug use only (non-benefit drug  use was misclassified as unexposed). All analyses were replicated within the same  cohort of new users of antidiabetic agents for clopidogrel and β-blocker (bisoprolol  or carvedilol) users versus nonusers because these agents were also subject to  exposure misclassification from non-benefit drug use during the period of the study.  FINDINGS: Among 27,333 new users of antidiabetic agents, we identified 5759 TZD  users (28% non-benefit) and 21,574 nonusers of TZDs. The crude HR for  hospitalization or death among TZD users versus nonusers was higher in a database  that contained benefit-only prescriptions than in a database that contained all  prescriptions (HR = 1.11 [95% CI, 1.05-1.18] vs HR = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.04]).

Physicians  assigned a primary clinical category to each reviewed report. We used empirical  Bayesian data mining to identify AEs that were disproportionally reported after Hib  vaccines. RESULTS: VAERS received 29,747 reports after Hib vaccines; 5179 (17%) were  serious, including 896 reports of deaths. Median age was 6 months (range 0-1022  months). Sudden infant death syndrome was the stated cause of death in 384 (51%) of  749 death reports with autopsy/death certificate records. The most common nondeath  serious AE categories were neurologic (80; 37%), other noninfectious (46; 22%)  (comprising mainly constitutional signs and symptoms); and gastrointestinal (39;  18%) conditions. No new safety concerns were identified after clinical review of  reports of AEs that exceeded the data mining statistical threshold. CONCLUSION:  Review of VAERS reports did not identify any new or unexpected safety concerns for  Hib vaccines.', NULL, NULL);

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study,  we linked Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data for all incident kidney  transplants 2001-2012 and national pharmacy claims (n = 46,914). We compared  recipients having one or more pharmacy claims for a metformin-containing product (n  = 4,609) and recipients having one or more claims for a non-metformin  glucose-lowering agent (n = 42,305). RESULTS: On average, metformin claims were  filled later after transplant and were associated with higher estimated glomerular  filtration rates before the first claim.

METHODS:  Electronic records for opioid dependent patients from three Pennsylvania residential  detoxification and treatment facilities (N = 7,687) were retrospectively analyzed.  We determined the proportion of patients who received XR-NTX (INJ), and compared  rates of treatment completion and engagement in follow-up care relative to a  naturalistic control group of patients recommended for, but not administered, XR-NTX  (Non-INJ).

METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical  records of all patients who underwent cranioplasty for cranial bone defects during  the period 2002-2012 was conducted, and 100 consecutive cranioplasty procedures that  met eligibility criteria were identified. Patients were analyzed in 4 groups, which  were created based on the cranioplasty material: autograft (nxa0= 20), bioactive  fiber-reinforced composite (nxa0= 20), hydroxyapatite (nxa0= 31), and other synthetic  materials (nxa0= 29). Survival estimates were constructed with Kaplan-Meier curves,  and the differences between categorical variable levels were determined using a  log-rank test. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using a Šidák correction. RESULTS:  During a median follow-up time of 14 months (interquartile range 3-39 months), 32 of  100 patients (32.0%) developed at least 1 complication. A minor complication  occurred in 13 patients (13.0%), whereas 19 patients (19.0%) developed a major  complication, which required reoperation or removal of the implant. In the autograft  subgroup, 40.0% of patients required removal of the cranioplasty. The 3-year  survival of the autograft subgroup was lower compared with other subgroups of  synthetic materials.

METHODS: Primary early-stage cHL patients who underwent CMT were included. Positron  emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), CT, or both were performed at  the initial staging, during or after chemotherapy, and for at least 2 years during  follow-up. Imaging studies and medical records were reviewed to determine if and  when relapse had occurred. Radiation doses and costs were also calculated from  follow-up imaging. RESULTS: The study included 78 patients with a median follow-up  of 46 months; 85% of the patients had stage II disease (32% with bulky disease).  Four of 77 interim PET scans were positive; none of these patients relapsed during  follow-up, which ranged from 24 to 80 months. After a total of 466 follow-up imaging  studies (91% with CT and 9% with PET/CT), no cHL relapse was detected. Eleven  abnormal findings were noted on surveillance imaging: 9 were false-positives, and 2  were second primary malignancies. The average cumulative dose per patient from  follow-up imaging was 107 mSv, which translated into an estimated lifetime excess  cancer risk of 0.5%; the estimated total costs were $296,817 according to Medicare  reimbursements. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance imaging with either CT or PET/CT can be  omitted safely for early-stage cHL treated with a combination of doxorubicin,  bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and radiation therapy because the risk of  relapse is extremely low. This observation also applies to patients with bulky  disease.

Although there was no statistically significant difference in  overall survival (71.9% vs 49.0%, p = 0.072), there was a trend of better overall  survival in the patients who received postoperative chemotherapy. On multivariable  analysis age (p = 0.018), tumor location (p = 0.003) and adjuvant chemotherapy (p =  0.001) were predictors of cancer specific survival.

A sequela of the increase in opioid  abuse has been an increase in the number of infants born with opioid dependence.  These infants often require costly, prolonged stays in the neonatal intensive care  unit (NICU) for drug withdrawal treatment. The authors studied a population of  infants from a large Medicaid health plan who were born with neonatal abstinence  syndrome (NAS) secondary to in utero opioid exposure to assess the average length of  stay in the NICU, and to determine the variables that may account for differences in  interinstitutional lengths of stay. The overall average length of stay for NAS was  21.1 days for the 139 infants included in the study. Analysis of the medication used  for treatment revealed that infants who were treated with a combined  inpatient/outpatient regimen with methadone had an average length of stay of 11.4  days versus 25.1 days for infants who were treated entirely as inpatients (P<0.001),  a 55% reduction in average length of stay. In 2009 there were an estimated 13,600  cases of NAS in the United States at a cost of $53,000 per case. A 55% reduction in  length of stay corresponds to $396 million in annual savings for the treatment of  NAS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the  records of 225 patients who underwent combined androgen blockade as first line  therapy for prostate cancer. The prognostic values of testosterone and other  clinical factors were evaluated with respect to prostate specific antigen  progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Median patient age was 73.0 years,  median prostate specific antigen was 42.6 ng/ml and median followup was 45.8 months.  No variable associated with testosterone was predictive of progression-free  survival. With regard to overall survival on univariate analysis nadir testosterone  less than 16 ng/dl (pxa0=xa00.0190), less than 20 ng/dl (p = 0.0020) and less than 32  ng/dl (p = 0.0146) were significant together with other clinical factors. In  contrast, nadir testosterone less than 8 and less than 12 ng/dl were not  significant. Multivariate analysis showed that nadir testosterone less than 20 ng/dl  was the significant prognostic factor (p = 0.0048). In addition, time to nadir  testosterone was about 1xa0year (11.3xa0months). Patients were divided into rapid and  slow types based on time to testosterone less than 20 ng/dl before and after 6  months, respectively. No significant difference in overall survival was observed  between the 2 types. The current results suggest that the critical factor for  prognosis was not a rapid decrease but whether nadir testosterone achieved a level  of less than 20 ng/dl.

The aim of this study was to estimate influenza vaccine  effectiveness (VE) among individuals aged 60+ years over three seasons and to assess  if the screening method is a suitable tool to monitor influenza VE in this  particular target-group in Germany. METHODS: We identified laboratory-confirmed  influenza cases aged 60+ years through the national communicable disease reporting  system for seasons 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13. Vaccination coverage (VC) data were  retrieved from a database of health insurance claims representing ~85% of the total  German population. We applied the screening method to calculate influenza  subtype-specific VE and compared our results with VE estimates from other  observational studies in Europe. RESULTS: In total, 7,156 laboratory-confirmed  influenza cases were included. VE against all influenza types ranged between 49%  (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39-56) in 2011/12 and 80% (95% CI: 76-83%) in  2010/11. In 2010/11 subtype-specific VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B was 76%  and 84%, respectively. In the following seasons, VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm,  A(H3N2) and B was 87%, -9% , 74% (2011/12), and 74%, 39%, 73% (2012/13). VE was  higher among hospitalized compared to non-hospitalized influenza A cases. Seventeen  observational studies from Europe reporting subtype-specific VE among the elderly  were identified for the respective seasons (all applying the test-negative design)  and showed comparable subtype-specific VE estimates. CONCLUSIONS: According to our  study, influenza vaccination provided moderate protection against  laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B in individuals aged 60+ but no or  only little protection against A(H3N2). Higher VE among hospitalized cases might  indicate higher protection against severe influenza disease. Based on the available  data, the screening method allowed us to assess subtype-specific VE in hospitalized  and non-hospitalized elderly persons. Since controlling for several important  confounders was not possible, the applied method only provided crude VE estimates.

The effect of these pharmaceutical market changes on  opioid dispensing and overdose rates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  association between 2 temporally proximate changes in the opioid market and opioid  dispensing and overdose rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Claims from a  large national US health insurer were analyzed, using an interrupted time series  study design. Participants included an open cohort of 31.3 million commercially  insured members aged 18 to 64 years between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012,  with median follow-up of 20 months (last follow-up, December 31, 2012). EXPOSURES:  Introduction of abuse-deterrent OxyContin (resistant to crushing or dissolving) on  August 9, 2010, and market withdrawal of propoxyphene on November 19, 2010. MAIN  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized opioid dispensing rates and prescription opioid  and heroin overdose rates were the primary outcomes. We used segmented regression to  analyze changes in outcomes from 30 quarters before to 8 quarters after the 2  interventions. RESULTS: Two years after the opioid market changes, total opioid  dispensing decreased by 19% from the expected rate (absolute change, -32.2 mg  morphine-equivalent dose per member per quarter [95% CI, -38.1 to -26.3]). By opioid  subtype, the absolute change in dispensing by milligrams of morphine-equivalent dose  per member per quarter at 2 years was -11.3 (95% CI, -12.4 to -10.1) for  extended-release oxycodone, 3.26 (95% CI, 1.40 to 5.12) for other long-acting  opioids, -8.19 (95% CI, -9.30 to -7.08) for propoxyphene, and -16.2 (95% CI, -18.8  to -13.5) for other immediate-release opioids. Two years after the market changes,  the estimated overdose rate attributed to prescription opioids decreased by 20%  (absolute change, -1.10 per 100,000 members per quarter [95% CI, -1.47 to -0.74]),  but heroin overdose increased by 23% (absolute change, 0.26 per 100,000 members per  quarter [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.53]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Opioid dispensing and  prescription opioid overdoses decreased substantially after 2 major changes in the  pharmaceutical market in late 2010.

The comparison group consisted of consecutive patients who underwent  similar surgical procedures at the same institution before protocol implementation.  All patients were asked to complete a postdischarge diary documenting the occurrence  of nausea and vomiting. Those who completed the diaries were included in this  analysis. Data were analyzed with the Fisher exact test and the Wilcoxon rank sum  test. A P value less than .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Diaries were  completed by 85% of patients in the intervention group (79 of 93) and 75% of  patients in the comparison group (103 of 137). Patients in the intervention (n = 79)  and comparison (n = 103) groups were similar in the proportion of patients with  validated risk factors for PDNV, including female gender, history of PONV, age  younger than 50 years, opioid use in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and nausea  in the PACU (P = .37). The prevalence of PDNV was unaffected by the antiemetic  protocol. After discharge, nausea was reported by 72% of patients in the  intervention group and 60% of patients in the comparison group (P = .13) and  vomiting was reported by 22% of patients in the intervention group and 29% of  patients in the comparison group (P = .40). CONCLUSION: Modalities that successfully  address PONV after Le Fort I osteotomy might fail to affect PDNV, which is prevalent  in this population. Future investigation will focus on methods to minimize PDNV.', NULL, NULL);

Despite  substantial morbidity and mortality, limited data are available describing  real-world treatment patterns and health care resource use in any European country.  We evaluated PC-related treatment patterns and associated health care resource use  among patients with metastatic PC in the United Kingdom and France. METHODS: One  hundred three oncology specialists (53 in France and 50 in the United Kingdom)  abstracted data from medical records of 400 patients whom they treated for  metastatic PC. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of metastatic PC at age 18 years or  older between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012; had ≥3 months of follow-up  time beginning at metastatic diagnosis; and received at least 1 cancer-directed  therapy for metastatic disease. Information on patient demographics, Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, location of primary tumor, presence  of comorbidities, adverse events, and complications were collected. Data on  cancer-directed treatments and supportive care measures were evaluated. All analyses  were descriptive. FINDINGS: Approximately two thirds of patients were men, and  median age at metastatic disease diagnosis was 62.2 years. Nearly all patients  (97.3%) received chemotherapy to treat metastatic disease, 9.3% received radiation  therapy, and 7.8% received a targeted therapy. Overall, the most frequently  administered first-line regimens for metastatic disease were gemcitabine alone  (46.0%), a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of oxaliplatin, irinotecan,  fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX; 20.1%); gemcitabine/capecitabine (10.8%);  and gemcitabine/oxaliplatin (9.5%). Approximately 40% of patients in France and 15%  of patients in the United Kingdom received second-line systemic therapy, whereas 20%  of patients in France and 3.4% of patients in the United Kingdom received third-line  systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Overall, 52.5% of patients experienced at  least one complication of PC. More than two thirds of patients had ≥1 office visit  unrelated to chemotherapy administration, 54.0% had ≥1 inpatient hospitalization,  36.8% had ≥1 emergency department visit, and 25.3% had ≥1 pain management clinic  visit. A total of 26.5% of patients in France and 42.5% in the United Kingdom  entered hospice or long-term care. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides new, detailed  information for patients with metastatic PC in real-world settings in 2 European  countries. A small proportion of patients received >1 line of systemic therapy for  metastatic disease, which is likely due to the aggressiveness of this disease and  the lack of effective therapeutic options.', NULL, NULL);

RESULTS: After its introduction in 2007, the  frequency of ENG implants increased each year and almost a third of all insertions  were in teenagers. However, among women ≤24 years old who had delivered an infant in  the prior 8 weeks, a LNG-IUS was more likely to be inserted than an ENG implant (P <  .05). The most frequent complications with both methods were related to abnormal  menstruation, which was more likely to occur among ENG implant users.

It is mainly used to treat severe psoriasis.  Like all systemic retinoids, acitretin is teratogenic. Strict pregnancy prevention  is required in women of childbearing potential who use acitretin. This study  assessed compliance with Pregnancy Prevention Plan (PPP) recommendations,  specifically looking at compliance with pregnancy testing (PT) and pregnancy  occurrence. METHODS: A cohort of 8672 women aged 15-49u2009years initiating acitretin  treatment from 1 January 2007 through 31 December 2013 was identified using French  SNIIRAM (administrative claims data) and PMSI (hospitalisations data) databases.  Pregnancy tests (PTs) were identified from reimbursed serum βHCG and urine  laboratory PTs. To satisfy PT criteria, patients who started treatment had to  undergo a PT within 3u2009days before acitretin was dispensed. Pregnancies were  identified by a pregnancy-related hospital stay or an outpatient medical abortion.  RESULTS: A PT was performed in only 12% of women starting treatment and was rarely  performed during treatment or during the 24u2009months following discontinuation of  treatment. Compliance with PPP recommendations although poor appeared to be better  among private dermatologists, as a PT was performed for 16% of treatment initiations  (vs. 4% for general practitioners, pu2009<u20090.001).

STUDY DESIGN:  Retrospective chart review of 4698 women attending a New Zealand public hospital  abortion clinic over 2 years (2010-2012) to describe postabortion contraceptive  choice, with follow-up via clinic and national births records to assess subsequent  pregnancies at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. RESULTS: Twenty percent of the cohort  (934/4698) received an implant, 26% an intrauterine method (927 copper intrauterine  device, 301 levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [LNG-IUS]), and 54% chose  other shorter-acting methods (2536/4698). Method choice was significantly associated  with age, ethnicity, and pregnancy history (p < .001). At 24 months, the unadjusted  incidence of subsequent abortion for implant users was 3.8% (95% confidence interval  [CI] = 2.5-5.0) and 11.6% (95% CI = 10.3-12.8) for those choosing other short-acting  methods. By 48 months, 6.6% of implant users had a subsequent abortion (compared  with 18.3% for short-acting methods). The incidence of continued pregnancy at 24  months was 6.3% (95% CI = 4.4-8.1) for implant users and 15.7% (95% CI = 14-17.2)  for those choosing other short-acting methods.

STUDY DESIGN: The records of 301 consecutive women  who underwent MTOP between July 2010 and July 2011 were studied retrospectively. The  follow-up protocol included ultrasound evaluation 2 weeks after MTOP. Surgical  termination was offered when pregnancy was found to be ongoing, and either  hysteroscopy/curettage or a repeat ultrasound 2 weeks later was offered when the  ultrasound findings were suspicious for retained products of conception.

Thus, annual surveillance may be  excessive. We hypothesized that less frequent postoperative surveillance in these  patients is cost effective. METHODS: A Markov discrete time state transition model  was created to compare postoperative surveillance tapered to 3-year intervals after  5 years of annual surveillance versus conventional annual surveillance in low-risk  PTC patients with negative neck ultrasound and stimulated thyroglobulin less than  2u2009ng/mL 1 year postoperatively. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were  determined via literature review, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, and  Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to  assess areas of uncertainty. RESULTS: The cost of annual surveillance was $5,239 per  patient and yielded 22.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The 3-year strategy  cost $2,601 less, but also yielded 0.01 less QALYs. Thus, the incremental cost per  QALY of annual surveillance was $260,100. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis  demonstrated that less frequent surveillance was more cost effective in 99.98% of  10,000 simulated patients. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that annual  surveillance would be cost effective if the total cost of neck ultrasound could be  reduced to $23 or less.

RESULTS: There was a clear  seasonal pattern in BW which, however, changed gradually across the study period.  The highest BWs were seen during fall (September - October) from 1936 to 1963, but a  new peak gradually grew from the early 1940s during early summer (May - June) and  became the highest from 1964 to 1989.

Recent retrospective  studies demonstrated that treatment with the sublingual film formulation is  associated with improved treatment retention and lower healthcare costs. In March  2013, generic buprerphine/loxone tablets were approved in the US. A budget  impact model was built to compare healthcare expenditures for different market  shares of sublingual film and tablet. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to track  a cohort of opioid dependent patients treated with sublingual film or tablet through  the following treatment phases: initiation, maintence, discontinuation,  off-treatment and reinitiation. Transition probabilities and costs for each phase  were estimated from the MarketScan Medicaid database for the period between 1 March  2010 and 30 June 2012. The total expenditure for the plan and expenditure per plan  member per month were predicted over 5 years. Two market share scerios were  considered: 1) sublingual film is progressively replaced by generic tablet (current  situation) and 2) the sublingual film holds a market share of 100%. RESULTS:  Predicted total costs over 5 years were $6400 million when the sublingual film holds  a market share of 100% (as per Scerio 2) which is lower than when sublingual film  is progressively replaced by generic tablet (current situation as per Scerio 1) by  $64 million. These savings were mostly driven by inpatient care ($56 million saved  over 5 years), followed by emergency room care ($27 million) and pharmaceutical  costs ($24 million). Costs of outpatient care attenuated the difference as they were  predicted to be higher by $44 million in Scerio 2. The reduction in total cost per  member per month reached $0.027 in the fifth year. Results were most sensitive to  price rebates and to the probability of n-psychiatric hospitalization.  CONCLUSIONS: While using the sublingual film formulation for more patients treated  with buprerphine/loxone is predicted to increase outpatient care costs, it would  generate savings in emergency care and hospitalizations. In the treatment of opioid  dependence, total direct medical costs for Medicaid would be lower for sublingual  film treated patients, at current drug prices.FAU - Asche, Carl VAU - Asche CVAD - a a University of Illiis College of Medicine at Peoria/University of Illiis at  Chicago College of Pharmacy , Peoria , IL , USA.FAU - Clay, EmilieAU - Clay EAD - b b Creativ-Ceutical , Paris , France.FAU - Kharitova, ElizavetaAU - Kharitova EAD - c c Creativ-Ceutical , Chicago , IL , USA.FAU - Zah, VladimirAU - Zah VAD - d d ZRx Outcomes Research Inc. , Mississauga , ON , Cada.FAU - Ruby, JaneAU - Ruby JAD - e e Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Richmond , VA , USA.', NULL, NULL);

Providence Cancer Center,  like other institutions, deferred the veus administration method to clinical  judgment incorporating patient preference. Patient experience was evaluated for  oxaliplatin-related local reactions by peripheral or central veus administration.  METHODS: A retrospective review of the electronic medical record was performed of  the period of January 2011 to March 2013 to identify patients who received  oxaliplatin. Included were 59 patients who were given the option of either  peripheral or central veus drug administration. The two patient groups (peripheral  vein vs. central vein administration) were compared in terms of frequency and type  of local reactions (redness/discoloration, swelling, numbness/cold, or  pain/discomfort). RESULTS: Nineteen (63.3%) of the patients in the peripheral vein  group experienced some type of local reaction compared to ne in the central vein  group (pu2009<u2009.0001). Pain was the most common local reaction, occurring in 17 (56.7%)  patients in the peripheral group. Despite the occurrence of a local reaction, the  majority of patients did t alter their initial choice of infusion method.

This retrospective observatiol database  study included 609 community oncology patients with resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC.  Use of adjuvant therapy was 39.1% at disease stage IB and 64.9% to 68.2% at stage II  to IIIA. The most common regimen at all stages was carboplatin and paclitaxel.  BACKGROUND: Platin-based adjuvant chemotherapy has extended survival in clinical  trials in patients with completely resected n-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  There are few data on the use of adjuvant therapy in community-based clinical  practice in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective  observatiol study using electronic medical record and billing data collected  during routine care at US community oncology sites in the Vector Oncology Data  Warehouse between January 2007 and January 2014. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a  primary diagsis of stage IB to IIIA NSCLC were eligible if they had undergone  surgical resection. Treatment patterns, health care resource use, and cost were  recorded, stratified by stage at diagsis. RESULTS: The study included 609 patients  (mean age, 64.8 years, 52.9% male), of whom 215 had stage IB disease, 130 stage  IIA/II, 110 stage IIB, and 154 stage IIIA. Adjuvant systemic therapy after resection  was provided to 345 (56.7%) of 609 patients, with lower use in patients with stage  IB disease (39.1%) than stage II to IIIA disease (64.9-68.2%) (P < .0001). The most  common adjuvant regimen at all stages was the combition of carboplatin and  paclitaxel. There were  statistically significant differences in office visits or  incidence of hospitalization by disease stage. During adjuvant treatment, the total  monthly median cost per patient was $17,389.75 (interquartile range, $8,815.61 to  $23,360.85). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant systemic therapy was used in some patients with  stage IB NSCLC and in the majority of patients with stage IIA to IIIA disease. There  were few differences in regimen or health care resource use by disease stage.', NULL, NULL);

The  two leading agents are similar in effectiveness but vary greatly in price-up to  $2,000 per injection for ranibizumab compared to $50 for bevacizumab. We examined  the diffusion of these drugs in fee-for-service Medicare and Veterans Affairs (VA)  systems during 2005-11, in part to assess the impact that differing fincial  incentives had on prescribing. Physicians treating Medicare patients have a direct  fincial incentive to prescribe the more expensive agent (ranibizumab), while VA  physicians do t. Medicare injections of the more expensive ranibizumab peaked in  2007 at 47xa0percent. Beginning in 2009 the less expensive bevacizumab became the  predomint therapy for Medicare patients, accounting for more than 60xa0percent of  injections. For VA patients, the distribution of injections across the two drugs was  relatively equal, particularly from 2009 to 2011. Our alysis indicates that there  are opportunities in both the VA and Medicare to adopt more value-conscious  treatment patterns and that multiple mechanisms exist to influence utilization.', NULL, NULL);

The objective of this study was to determine  whether recurrent CDI was independently associated with the number of hospital  readmissions and days readmitted. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study  at an academic, urban, tertiary care hospital. Data were collected from electronic  medical records and supplemented with chart review. CDI patients were followed for  180 days to ascertain the number of hospital readmissions and total days readmitted.  Univariate and multivariable negative bimial regression models were used to  evaluate factors, including CDI recurrence, associated with hospital readmissions.  RESULTS: The study included 3,950 patients with CDI from 2003-2009, including 413  patients with recurrent CDI. Recurrent CDI patients were significantly more likely  to have at least 1 readmission (85% vs 41%; P < .001) and had more days readmitted  (mean = 18.6 vs 7.6; P < .001) than patients without recurrent CDI. In multivariable  alysis, recurrent CDI was independently associated with number of readmissions  (rate ratio = 2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.21-2.91) and days readmitted  (rate ratio = 3.97; 95% CI, 3.11-5.08) after adjustment for demographics,  comorbidities, and medications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observatiol study was conducted before and  after the introduction of the consultation support system. The 1-year study period  was divided into two 6-month periods: before and after 1 December 2012 (baseline and  intervention periods, respectively), which was when our consultation support system  was introduced. Data from examitions were collected retrospectively from the  hospital information centre and problem reporting sheets in the radiology  department. The primary outcome was the incidence of RCM reactions before and after  the introduction of the consultation support system. Generalised estimating  equations were used to account for the correlation between the same patients  measured on multiple occasions. RESULTS: There were 317/20,179 (1.6%) and 186/19,873  (0.9%) hypersensitivity reactions during the baseline and intervention periods,  respectively. The consultation support system significantly decreased the odds of  the occurrence of a RCM reaction (OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.71, p<0.001) compared  with baseline. There was also a twofold increase in the premedication rate after  initiation of the consultation support system (OR=2.05, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.65 p=0.01).  However, there was  significant difference in the recurrence rate between the  periods (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.65, p<0.93).

While the reporting of  HPAI suspicions is mandatory, private actors had more access to information than  public actors. Actors of the upstream sector (medicine and feed sellers) played a  key role in the diffusion of information. The central role of these actors and the  influence of the information flow on the adoption by poultry production stakeholders  of behaviors limiting (e.g. prevention measures) or promoting disease transmission  (e.g. increased animal movements) should be accounted for in the design of  surveillance and control programs.', NULL, NULL);
