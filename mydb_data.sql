The aim of this study was to evaluate the  demographic characteristics, response to treatments, and outcomes of a cohort of  patients who developed immune cytopenias following SOT. PROCEDURE: In this single  center retrospective review, patients with immune cytopenias after SOT were  identified by electronic medical record (EMR) search and transplant databases from  1995-2012. RESULTS: Of 764 SOT patients, 19 (2.4%) developed immune cytopenias.  Incidence varied widely by transplant type from 1.2% (rel) to 23.5%  (multivisceral). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) was the most common immune  cytopenia. Overall median time from transplant to immune cytopenia was 8u2009m and  varied by transplant type from 3u2009m (liver) to 74u2009m (heart). Standard therapies for  immune cytopenias were often used and ineffective. The most effective therapy for  the immune cytopenia was changing immunosuppression from tacrolimus to another  agent. Three of 19 patients died; none directly attributed to the immune cytopenia.  CONCLUSIONS: Immune cytopenias are not rare after SOT, and patients usually do not  respond well to traditiol first line therapies. Provided that the risk of organ  rejection is otherwise mageable, temporary cessation of tacrolimus could be more  widely explored in this challenging clinical context.

STUDY  DESIGN: A retrospective study of health insurance claims records from 2007 through  2011 identified a cohort of women who had LNG-IUS (n = 79,920) or ENG implants (n =  7374) inserted and had insurance coverage for 12 months postinsertion. Claims for  complications were examined 12 months after insertion, or until removal of either  device within each of 3 age groups. RESULTS: After its introduction in 2007, the  frequency of ENG implants increased each year and almost a third of all insertions  were in teegers. However, among women ≤24 years old who had delivered an infant in  the prior 8 weeks, a LNG-IUS was more likely to be inserted than an ENG implant (P <  .05). The most frequent complications with both methods were related to abnormal  menstruation, which was more likely to occur among ENG implant users. Overall,  83-88% of the entire sample used their chosen method for at least 12 months. The  odds of continuation were similar for both methods among teegers, but ENG implants  were more likely to be removed prematurely among women 20-24 years old (odds ratio,  1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.39) and 25-44 years old (odds ratio, 1.49; 95%  confidence interval, 1.35-1.64).

METHODS: The cases were defined  as patients with positive blood cultures for Bcc from October 10, 2013-December 16,  2013. We reviewed medical records, interviewed health care workers, and audited the  clinical laboratory. A microbiologic culture for a suspected antiseptic was  performed, and interventions were instituted. RESULTS: During the outbreak period,  Bcc were isolated from 46 blood cultures from 40 patients.

A  secondary alysis of this trial conducted on patient-reported health care resource  utilization (HCRU) endpoints revealed significantly fewer monthly telephone  consultations and emergency department visits among patients treated with pazopanib  over the first 6 months of treatment. OBJECTIVES: To (a) compare total costs of HCRU  and adverse events (AEs) in patients with advanced RCC receiving first-line  pazopanib or sunitinib from the phase III clinical trial and (b) perform a post hoc  economic alysis that applied direct medical care and pharmacy unit costs, obtained  from the Truven Health MarketScan Databases, to HCRU and AE rates. METHODS: Total  HCRU costs included components for provider contacts, diagnostics, hospitalizations,  procedures, and study/nonstudy drugs. Patients were stratified by the presence or  absence of an AE in order to estimate costs attributable to AEs. Costs were adjusted  to 2013 U.S. dollars. The highest 1% of cost outliers were equally excluded from  each group. Univariate (t-test and Kaplan-Meier sample average [KMSA]) and  multivariate (using treatment group and region as covariates) alyses were  performed. RESULTS: A total of 906 patients (pazopanib, n = 454; sunitinib, n = 452)  reported HCRU; higher rates were observed for sunitinib. In udjusted cost  alyses, the mean total costs for pazopanib-treated patients were 8.0% lower than  those treated with sunitinib ($80,464 vs. $86,886; P = 0.20). The difference in  KMSA-estimated costs was significantly higher for sunitinib versus pazopanib  ($156,128 vs. $143,585; P = 0.003). Adjusted cost differences between arms  consistently suggested higher costs for sunitinib. Among patients who experienced  greater than or equal to 1 AE, costs were $8,118 higher for pazopanib-treated  patients and $14,343 for sunitinib-treated patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to  describe antidiabetic treatment patterns in Medicare Advantage patients with T2DM  within 6 months of measurement of the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level.  RESEARCH DESIGN: This retrospective cross-sectiol study utilized medical,  pharmacy, and laboratory claims from a large Medicare Advantage with Prescription  Drug (MAPD) coverage payer. MAPD members between 65 and 89 years old identified as  having T2DM between 2009 and 2011 were eligible for inclusion.

Cerebral vasospasm is a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage that  contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. Nimodipine has been used in  adults to reduce the incidence of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage  and improve long-term outcomes. There are, however, no data in children. METHODS:  Records of children with a confirmed diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage who  received nimodipine between January 1, 2005 and August 31, 2013 were reviewed.  Dosing of nimodipine and associated hypotensive events were recorded. Transcranial  Doppler ultrasonography, cranial computerized tomography, and angiography were  followed as a measure of cerebral vasospasm, rebleeding, and subsequent infarction.  RESULTS: Twelve children (average age 11.8 ± 3.3 years, age range 3.5 to 17.3 years)  were included. Aneurysm was responsible for the highest percentage (41.7%) of  subarachnoid hemorrhage events. The mean dose of oral nimodipine was 1 mg/kg every 4  hours and was associated with a high rate of hypotension requiring intervention or  dose modification. Clinical outcomes while on nimodipine therapy varied; evidence of  vasospasm was observed in 67%, new infarction in 33%, and rebleeding in 17%.  Functiol and cognitive deficits were minor in two-thirds and absent in the  remaining individuals. All patients survived until hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS:  Oral nimodipine after subarachnoid hemorrhage in children does not elimite  vasospasm, rebleeding, or infarction and is associated with significant hypotension.

RESULTS: Of 27 467 patients receiving  rivaroxaban, 496 MB events occurred in 478 patients, an incidence of 2.86 per 100  person-years (95% confidence interval: 2.61-3.13). The MB patients were older, mean  (SD) age of 78.4 (7.7) vs 75.7 (9.7) years, compared with non-MB patients. Patients  with MB had higher rates of hypertension (95.6% vs 75.8%), corory artery disease  (64.2% vs 36.7%), heart failure (48.5% vs 23.7%), and rel disease (38.7% vs  16.7%). Of MB patients, 63.2% were taking 20 mg, 32.2% 15 mg, and 4.6% 10 mg of  rivaroxaban. Four percent of MB patients took warfarin within the prior 30 days.  Major bleeding was most commonly gastrointestil (88.5%) or intracranial (7.5%).  Although 46.7% of MB patients received a transfusion, none had sufficient evidence  of receiving any type of clotting factor. Fourteen died during their MB  hospitalization, yielding a fatal bleeding incidence rate of 0.08 per 100  person-years (95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.14). Mean age at death was 82.4 years.  CONCLUSIONS: In this large observatiol study, the MB rate was generally consistent  with the registration trial results, and fatal bleeds were rare.', NULL, 0);

Catheter-related  bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) are a common and potentially fatal complication of  HPN. The risk factors for development of CR-BSI in the outpatient setting are poorly  understood. METHODS: We conducted an observatiol, retrospective study of 225  patients discharged from Barnes-Jewish Hospital on HPN between January 1, 2007, and  December 31, 2009. HPN complications were defined as any cause that led to either  premature discontinuation of HPN therapy or catheter replacement. CR-BSI events were  identified by provider documentation. We calculated the overall complication rate  and the complication rate specifically due to CR-BSI. Backward stepwise Cox  regression alyses were used to assess for independent predictors of  catheter-related complications. RESULTS: In total, 111 of 225 patients (49%)  developed complications while receiving HPN (incidence = 5.06 episodes/1000 catheter  days). Sixty-eight of 225 patients (30%) required catheter removal for CR-BSI  (incidence = 3.10 episodes/1000 catheter days). Independent predictors of line  removal specifically due to infection included anticoagulant use, ulcer or open  wound, and Medicare or Medicaid insurance. The following risk factors were  associated with catheter-associated complications and/or CR-BSI: the presence of  ulcers, the use of systemic anticoagulants, public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid),  and patient age. Independent predictors of line removal for any complication  included age and anticoagulant use. CONCLUSION: Catheter-related complications were  extremely common in patients receiving HPN.

METHODS: New users of  antidiabetic agents were identified with a 1-year washout period between January 1,  1995, and December 31, 2005, in Saskatchewan, Cada, and were followed until  December 31, 2008. Within this population-based cohort, persons were classified as  users of benefit or non-benefit thiazolidinediones (TZDs) according to their first  prescription record between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2006 (non-benefit  prescription records were not captured before 2006). An intention-to-treat approach  was used to categorize TZD exposure over time. We evaluated the potential bias  introduced by drug exposure misclassification by evaluating bootstrapped differences  in hazard ratio (HR) estimates of all-cause hospitalization or death between users  and nonusers of TZDs obtained from alyses that contained complete drug use  (non-benefit and benefit drug use) versus benefit drug use only (non-benefit drug  use was misclassified as unexposed). All alyses were replicated within the same  cohort of new users of antidiabetic agents for clopidogrel and β-blocker (bisoprolol  or carvedilol) users versus nonusers because these agents were also subject to  exposure misclassification from non-benefit drug use during the period of the study.  FINDINGS: Among 27,333 new users of antidiabetic agents, we identified 5759 TZD  users (28% non-benefit) and 21,574 nonusers of TZDs. The crude HR for  hospitalization or death among TZD users versus nonusers was higher in a database  that contained benefit-only prescriptions than in a database that contained all  prescriptions (HR = 1.11 [95% CI, 1.05-1.18] vs HR = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.04]).  However, the differences in HRs after adjustment for demographic characteristics,  health care utilization, comorbidities, and medications suggested minimal bias was  introduced when TZD exposure was misclassified in the benefit-only database  (adjusted HR [aHR] = 1.04 [95% CI. 0.98-1.10] vs aHR = 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.04];  bootstrapped aHR difference = +0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.08]). Minimal differences in  aHRs were also observed within alyses of clopidogrel (1551 users [24%  non-benefit]; bootstrapped aHR difference = +0.01 [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.06]) and  β-blocker users (351 users [42% non-benefit]; bootstrapped aHR difference = +0.06  [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.20]) versus nonusers.

It is currently unclear how often appropriate medication selection  and dosage adjustment occurs in practice. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate  the extent of potentially ippropriate prescribing (PIP) (the use of a  contraindicated medication or ippropriately high dose according to the rel  function) in patients with rel impairment from admission through to discharge from  the Royal Hobart Hospital (RHH), Tasmania, Australia; to evaluate the medications  most commonly implicated in PIP; and the factors associated with PIP in rel  impairment. METHODS: Medical records of 251 patients consecutively admitted to the  RHH aged 40 years and above, with a creatinine clearance of ≤60u2009mL/min, and  hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus in their medical history, were reviewed. PIP  was assessed using the Australian Medicines Handbook and/or product information.  RESULTS: Of the 251 patients, 81 (32.3%) were receiving a total of 116 potentially  ippropriate medications (PIMs) at the time of admission. The number of patients  receiving PIMs (81 vs. 44, p<0.001 chi-square test) as well as the total number of  PIMs (116 vs. 63, p<0.001 Wilcoxon signed rank test) were significantly decreased at  discharge. Metformin was the most common PIM at admission. However, PIP of metformin  was reduced by approximately 50% by discharge.

Factors that significantly  correlated with PE-related mortality on univariate alysis were: age above 60 years  (odds ratio 19.1, P = 0.05), RV/LV diameter >1.5 (odds ratio 48.8, P < 0.001), RV/LV  area >1 (odds ratio 8.6, P = 0.06), bolus curve upslope time >6 seconds (odds ratio  23.3, P = 0.04), 50% downslope time >6 seconds (odds ratio 20, P = 0.01), and  embolus load score >15 (odds ratio 25, P = 0.03). The predictive value of upslope  time (Exp(B) 1.65, P = 0.05), RV/LV diameter (Exp(B) 43.8, P = 0.01), and RV/LV area  (Exp(B) 16.7, P = 0.01) were confirmed to be statistically significant in  multivariate alyses.

The  eyes were classified by the presence or absence of the track lines in the SD OCT  images after the resolution of macular edema. The correlation between the presence  of the track lines and the integrity of the photoreceptors was determined. RESULTS:  Twenty-one of 59 (36%) eyes had track lines in the SD OCT images after a resolution  of the macular edema during the follow-up period.

METHODS: Adults who initiated hypertension  treatment with a beta blocker were identified from the MarketScan * claims database  (2008-2012). Patients were classified based on their first beta blocker use:  nebivolol, atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and other beta blockers. Patients with  compelling indications for atenolol, carvedilol or metoprolol (acute corory  syndrome and congestive heart failure) were excluded. Patients enrolled in health  maintence organization or capitated point of service insurance plans were also  excluded. Persistence was defined as continuous use of the index drug (<60 day gap).  The average effect of persistence on medical costs (2012 USD) was estimated using  generalized linear models (GLMs). Regression estimates were used to predict medical  cost differences associated with persistence between nebivolol and the other  cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 587,424 hypertensive patients met the inclusion  criteria. Each additiol month of persistence with any one beta blocker was  associated with $152.51 in all-cause medical cost savings; continuous treatment for  1 year was associated with $1585.98 in all-cause medical cost savings. Patients  treated with nebivolol had longer persistence during the 1 year study period  (median: 315 days) than all other beta blockers (median: 156-292 days).

The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)  were 3 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-3.2] and 20 months (95% CI  11.1-28.9), respectively. CONCLUSION: Topotecan administered as a weekly dosage  (2.75-4 mg/m(2)) seems to be a tolerable regimen with modest activity in a Taiwanese  population. Although the lower dose schedule showed a higher response with a better  toxicity profile, further studies with more cases are needed to confirm this  finding.', NULL, 0);

Additiolly colonization is associated with increased risk of  infection. AIM: To determine the prevalence of both meticillin-resistant S. aureus  (MRSA) and meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) carriage in our haemodialysis  cohort and to identify any risk factors predisposing to carriage, recolonization, or  persistent carriage following a decolonization programme. METHODS: All haemodialysis  patients screened for S. aureus carriage between June 2009 and May 2011 were  retrospectively followed up for 18 months using hospital electronic records.  Statistical alysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 19. FINDINGS: Out of 578  patients screened, 288 patients (49%) had at least one positive swab (10% MRSA, 90%  MSSA). Of these patients, 265 completed a course of decolonization therapy following  which 36% successfully eradicated (eradicators) and 64% did not (non-eradicators).  There was no statistically significant difference in patient demography, type of  vascular access, 18-month patient mortality, or number of hospital admissions  between the two groups. Those who failed to eradicate were more likely to have had  an episode of S. aureus bacteraemia within the study period compared to those who  successfully decolonized (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Half of our haemodialysis cohort  was colonized with S. aureus at any one time over an 18-month period. Following  decolonization, one-third of patients remained successfully eradicated for 18  months. Non-eradicators have an increased risk of bacteraemia, which is associated  with poor mortality.

Use of adjuvant therapy was 39.1% at disease stage IB and 64.9% to 68.2% at stage II  to IIIA. The most common regimen at all stages was carboplatin and paclitaxel.  BACKGROUND: Platin-based adjuvant chemotherapy has extended survival in clinical  trials in patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  There are few data on the use of adjuvant therapy in community-based clinical  practice in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective  observatiol study using electronic medical record and billing data collected  during routine care at US community oncology sites in the Vector Oncology Data  Warehouse between January 2007 and January 2014. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a  primary diagnosis of stage IB to IIIA NSCLC were eligible if they had undergone  surgical resection.

We alyzed if there are preexisting medical conditions  associated with complications and compared the effect of different implant materials  on the degree of complications. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical  records of all patients who underwent cranioplasty for cranial bone defects during  the period 2002-2012 was conducted, and 100 consecutive cranioplasty procedures that  met eligibility criteria were identified. Patients were alyzed in 4 groups, which  were created based on the cranioplasty material: autograft (nxa0= 20), bioactive  fiber-reinforced composite (nxa0= 20), hydroxyapatite (nxa0= 31), and other synthetic  materials (nxa0= 29). Survival estimates were constructed with Kaplan-Meier curves,  and the differences between categorical variable levels were determined using a  log-rank test. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using a Šidák correction. RESULTS:  During a median follow-up time of 14 months (interquartile range 3-39 months), 32 of  100 patients (32.0%) developed at least 1 complication. A minor complication  occurred in 13 patients (13.0%), whereas 19 patients (19.0%) developed a major  complication, which required reoperation or removal of the implant. In the autograft  subgroup, 40.0% of patients required removal of the cranioplasty. The 3-year  survival of the autograft subgroup was lower compared with other subgroups of  synthetic materials.

The aim of this study is to assess the hyperkalemia risk and  combined use of spironolactone and long-term ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)  inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for heart failure in a  real-life setting of a heterogeneous population. METHODS: Using claims data of the  statutory health insurance fund AOK, covering 30% of the German population, we  performed a nested case-control study in a cohort of heart failure patients  receiving continuous ACE/ARB therapy (nu2009=u20091,491,894).

A range of case definitions for  NE was formulated based on diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and use of  psychotropic medications. Using a matched nested case-control design, three controls  were matched to each case on age, gender and geographic region, and assigned a  matching index date. Exposure to montelukast was measured as any exposure during the  year, recency of exposure, cumulative duration of exposure, and cumulative dose.

Vitamin D3 is predomintly provided by the action of  UVB from sunlight on skin. Average UK diets supply 2-3 μg/d vitamin D but diets  containing at least one portion of oily fish per week supply about 7 μg/d.  Pharmacological doses of vitamin D2 (bolus injection of 7500 μg or intakes >50 μg/d)  result in a smaller increase in plasma 25(OH)D than those of D3 but physiological  doses 5-25 μg/d seem equivalent. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations are also influenced  by clothing, obesity and skin pigmentation. Up to 40 % of the population have plasma  25(OH)D concentrations <25 nmol/l in the winter compared with <10 % in the summer.  The relative risk of CVD death is 1·41 (95 % CI 1·18, 1·68) greater in the lowest  quintile of plasma 25(OH)D according to meta-alysis of prospective cohort studies.  Acute deficiency may inhibit insulin secretion and promote inflammation thus  increasing the risk of plaque rupture and arterial thrombosis. Chronic insufficiency  may increase arterial stiffness. There is no evidence to support claims of reduced  CVD from existing trials with bone-related health outcomes where vitamin D was  usually co-administered with calcium. Although several trials with cardiovascular  endpoints are in progress, these are using pharmacological doses.

METHODS: Data were collected and alysed  retrospectively from electronic and paper records between February 2009 and August  2012.

This has implications for the real-world cost of  treatment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the utilization patterns and costs associated with  the use of etanercept, adalimumab, and ustekinumab among patients with  moderate-to-severe psoriasis. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectiol  study. Patients with 2 or more medical claims with a diagnosis of psoriasis  (excluding psoriatic arthritis) who were enrolled in large employer-sponsored health  plans (including a pharmacy benefit) in the United States from January 2007 to March  2012 were identified and extracted from the MarketScan Commercial Encounters  Database. Patients aged at least 18 years were required to have 2 or more pharmacy  claims for etanercept, adalimumab, or ustekinumab; the index date was the first  biologic fill date. Demographics and comorbidities were identified during the 1-year  pre-index period, and medication utilization and costs were evaluated in the 1-year  post-index period after a titration period according to the product prescribing  information (2 weeks to 12 weeks). Medication utilization parameters such as dose  escalation, dose reduction, persistence, switching, discontinuation, and restarts  were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 months from the end of the dose titration window.  RESULTS: A total of 4,309 patients were included with a mean average age of 46  years, and 55% were male. Fifty-seven percent of the patients were started on  etanercept, 39% on adalimumab, and 5% on ustekinumab. Patients had substantial dose  escalation rates (etanercept: 41%; adalim-umab: 37%; ustekinumab: 36%, Pu2009 less than  u20090.05) and discontinuation rates (etanercept: 35%; adalimumab: 27%; ustekinumab:  16%, Pu2009 less than u20090.05) over the 12-month post-titration period. Many patients also  restarted the same biologic (etanercept: 37%; adalimumab: 10%; ustekinumab: 6%, Pu2009  less than u20090.05) or switched to another biologic (etanercept: 15%; adalimumab: 10%;  ustekinumab: 5%, Pu2009 less than u20090.05) over the 12-month post-titration period. The  persistence rates over 12 months were 19%, 53%, and 71% for etanercept, adalimumab,  and ustekinumab, respectively (Pu2009 less than u20090.05). Close to one-third of the  patients at 6 months and 39% at 12 months postdose titration experienced a dose  escalation. Approximately half of the patients who experienced a dose escalation  also had a discontinuation or a dose reduction over the 12-month post-titration  period.

Few studies have  estimated the association between real-world talizumab persistence behavior and  relapse-related outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To (a) examine the impact of using talizumab  consistently (i.e., persistent) on relapse-related outcomes as compared with  transitioning to inconsistent talizumab use (i.e., nonpersistent) and (b) examine  the impact of other treatment patterns on relapse-related outcomes for those who  initiated talizumab. METHODS: Using the IMS PharMetrics Plus claims database  (years 2006-2012), we identified MS subjects who initiated talizumab (no  talizumab claims in year prior) and had at least 2 years of follow-up. Persistence  in annual follow-up periods was defined as no 90-day or greater gap in talizumab  therapy. Relapse was an MS-related hospitalization or outpatient visit with  intravenous or oral steroid burst claim within 7 days. Alyses compared  observations based on changes in talizumab persistence and talizumab  nonpersistence status from 1 year to the next (e.g., transitioning from persistent  to nonpersistent), estimating differences in mean annual relapses and mean annual  relapse-related costs. RESULTS: A total of 2,407 talizumab initiators had at least  2 years of follow-up, yielding 4,770 year-to-year talizumab treatment patterns  where each subject contributed 1, 2, or 3 year-to-year treatment patterns. In the  year prior, 3,187 treatment patterns were persistent; 731 (22.9%) of these  transitioned to nonpersistence. The remaining 1,583 treatment patterns were  nonpersistent in the year prior; 132 (8.3%) of these transitioned to persistence.  Persistent to nonpersistent treatment patterns were associated with a mean  relapse-rate increase of 0.23 (95% CIu2009=u20090.12, 0.35), and a mean increase in  relapse-related costs of $1,346 (95% CIu2009=u2009$97, $2,595). Nonpersistent to persistent  treatment patterns were associated with a mean relapse-rate decrease of -0.15 (95%  CIu2009=u2009-0.32, 0.017) and a mean decrease in relapse-related costs of -$1,369 (95%  CIu2009=u2009-$2,761, $23).

However, patterns, risk factors and  treatment associated with this event remain poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: To determine  patterns, risk factors and treatment related to PICC-DVT in hospitalized patients.  DESIGN, SETTING & PATIENTS: Between 2012-2013, consecutive cases of  ultrasound-confirmed, symptomatic PICC-DVT were identified. For each case, at least  two contemporaneous controls were identified and matched by age and gender. Patient-  and device-specific data were obtained through electronic-medical records. Using  variables selected a priori, multivariable logistic regression models were fit to  the outcome of PICC-DVT, comparing cases to controls. RESULTS: 909 adult  hospitalized patients (268 cases, 641 controls) were included in the study.  Indications for PICC placement included long-term intravenous antibiotic therapy  (n=447; 49.1%), in-hospital venous access for blood draws or infusion of medications  (n=342; 44.2%), and total parenteral nutrition (n=120; 6.7%). Patients with PICC-DVT  were more likely to have a history of venous thromboembolism (OR 1.70, 95%  CI=1.02-2.82) or have undergone surgery while the PICC was in situ (OR 2.17,  95%CI=1.17-4.01 for surgeries longer than two hours). Treatment for PICC-DVT varied  and included heparin bridging, low molecular weight heparin only and device removal  only; the average duration of treatment also varied across these groups. Compared to  4-Fr PICCs, 5- and 6-Fr PICCs were associated with greater risk of DVT (OR 2.74,  95%CI=0.75-10.09 and OR 7.40 95%CI=1.94-28.16, respectively). Patients who received  both aspirin and statins were less likely to develop PICC-DVT than those that  received neither treatment (OR 0.31, 95%CI=0.16-0.61). Receipt of pharmacological  DVT prophylaxis during hospitalization showed a non-significant trend towards  reduction in risk of PICC-DVT (OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.48-1.08).

Prior studies showed that the  guidelines coincided with a small increase in glucose testing of children and adults  but had limited follow-up. This study sought to evaluate changes in metabolic  screening of children initiating second-generation antipsychotics around the time of  the 2004 guidelines and in the following eight years. METHODS: Study patients  (N=52,407) were identified in a large tionwide commercial insurance claims  database for the period January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2011. The study  population was a cohort of nondiabetic new users of second-generation antipsychotics  who were ages 5-18. Glucose and HbA1c tests completed before and after  second-generation antipsychotic initiation were identified with Current Procedural  Terminology-4 codes. Metabolic screening was also examined by second-generation  antipsychotic agent prescribed and psychiatric diagnosis. RESULTS: The proportion of  patients receiving a glucose test preinitiation increased from 17.9% in 2003 to  18.9% in 2004, and testing postinitiation increased from 14.7% to 16.6% in the same  period. The slight increase in glucose testing was not sustained; the proportion  tested dropped in the following years before rising again in 2008. Glucose screening  was most common for patients taking aripiprazole. Patients with a diagnosis of  hyperkinetic disorder were less likely to be tested. HbA1c testing was less frequent  but had a similar usage pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The small improvement in metabolic  screening immediately after the 2004 ADA guidelines were issued was not sustained.

METHODS: We reviewed the  records of 535 IV-rtPA-treated patients who presented to our primary stroke centers.  The diagnosis of SM or transient ischemic attack (TIA) was based on patient  presentation, hospital course, electroencephalography, and negative neuroimaging  studies. The excess cost alysis compared actual direct and indirect hospital costs  of a patient to what their direct and indirect hospital costs would have been had  they primarily been diagnosed with mimic or TIA. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients  post-IV-rtPA treatment had fil diagnosis of SM; 21 had TIAs. The excess direct and  indirect hospital costs for mimics were $257,975 and $152,813, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective observatiol study was conducted before and  after the introduction of the consultation support system. The 1-year study period  was divided into two 6-month periods: before and after 1 December 2012 (baseline and  intervention periods, respectively), which was when our consultation support system  was introduced. Data from examitions were collected retrospectively from the  hospital information centre and problem reporting sheets in the radiology  department. The primary outcome was the incidence of RCM reactions before and after  the introduction of the consultation support system. Generalised estimating  equations were used to account for the correlation between the same patients  measured on multiple occasions. RESULTS: There were 317/20,179 (1.6%) and 186/19,873  (0.9%) hypersensitivity reactions during the baseline and intervention periods,  respectively. The consultation support system significantly decreased the odds of  the occurrence of a RCM reaction (OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.71, p<0.001) compared  with baseline. There was also a twofold increase in the premedication rate after  initiation of the consultation support system (OR=2.05, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.65 p=0.01).  However, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate between the  periods (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.65, p<0.93).

METHODS: Primary early-stage cHL patients who underwent CMT were included. Positron  emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), CT, or both were performed at  the initial staging, during or after chemotherapy, and for at least 2 years during  follow-up. Imaging studies and medical records were reviewed to determine if and  when relapse had occurred. Radiation doses and costs were also calculated from  follow-up imaging. RESULTS: The study included 78 patients with a median follow-up  of 46 months; 85% of the patients had stage II disease (32% with bulky disease).  Four of 77 interim PET scans were positive; none of these patients relapsed during  follow-up, which ranged from 24 to 80 months. After a total of 466 follow-up imaging  studies (91% with CT and 9% with PET/CT), no cHL relapse was detected. Eleven  abnormal findings were noted on surveillance imaging: 9 were false-positives, and 2  were second primary maligncies. The average cumulative dose per patient from  follow-up imaging was 107 mSv, which translated into an estimated lifetime excess  cancer risk of 0.5%; the estimated total costs were $296,817 according to Medicare  reimbursements. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance imaging with either CT or PET/CT can be  omitted safely for early-stage cHL treated with a combition of doxorubicin,  bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and radiation therapy because the risk of  relapse is extremely low. This observation also applies to patients with bulky  disease. The elimition of surveillance imaging will also reduce healthcare  expenses and cumulative radiation doses in these predomintly young patients.', NULL, 0);

Nevertheless, a few  case studies have shown liver toxicities of tacrolimus, particularly in patients on  multiple medications. This study is a retrospective data alysis on the potential  of tacrolimus hepatotoxicity. METHODS: A data alysis was conducted on the  electronic medical records (EMRs) of 2,462 Korean patients taking tacrolimus or  cyclosporine from 2002 through to 2008. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total  bilirubin level (TBL) were also monitored. The maximum ALT, time to reach ALTmax  (TALTmax), and TBL(ALTmax) were compared between the tacrolimus and cyclosporine  groups. Other possible factors that may aggravate liver function were also  investigated. RESULTS: ALTmax and TBL(ALTmax) were higher in the tacrolimus group  compared to the cyclosporine group (i.e., 50 IU/L vs. 41 IU/L and 1 mg/dL vs. 0.9  mg/dL, respectively), and TALTmax was shorter (i.e., 101 days vs. 142 days) in the  tacrolimus group. In addition, the frequency of ALTmax > 3x upper limit of normal  (ULN) (i.e., ALTmax > 120) was significantly increased in the tacrolimus group  compared to the cyclosporine group (30% vs. 21%). The severity of tacrolimusinduced  liver damage was greater in patients with history of liver disease, as indicated by  > two-fold greater ALTmax than that of cyclosporine (i.e., 153 IU/L vs. 65 IU/L).  Moreover, the ALTmax was significantly lowered by switching from tacrolimus to  cyclosporine in patients with a history of liver disease. In patients with  preexisting rel disease, neither tacrolimus nor cyclosporine showed any effect on  ALTmax.

However, to date,  there are no published long-term clinical data on the cost-effectiveness of  trabeculectomy with mitomycin vs tube insertion. OBJECTIVE: To assess the  cost-effectiveness of these procedures compared with maximal medical treatment.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used the Markov cohort model with a 5-year  time horizon to study a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 patients who required  glaucoma surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)  gained, costs from the societal perspective, and the incremental cost-effectiveness  ratio of medical treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion. Costs were  identified from Medicare Current Procedural Terminology and Ambulatory Payment  Classification reimbursement codes and Red Book medication costs. The QALYs were  based on visual field and visual acuity outcomes. The hypothetical societal limit to  resources was included using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY.  Costs and utilities were discounted at 3% per year. Uncertainty was assessed using  deterministic sensitivity alyses. RESULTS: The mean costs for medical treatment,  trabeculectomy, and tube insertion were $6172, $7872 and $10 075, respectively;  these amounts resulted in a cost difference of $1700 (95% CI, $1644-$1770) for  medical treatment vs trabeculectomy, $3904 (95% CI, $3858-$3953) for medical  treatment vs tube insertion, and $2203 (95% CI, $2121-$2261) for trabeculectomy vs  tube insertion. The mean 5-year probability of blindness was 4% for both surgical  procedures and 15% for medical treatment. The utility gained after medical  treatment, trabeculectomy, and tube insertion was 3.10, 3.30, and 3.38 QALYs,  respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $8289 per QALY for  trabeculectomy vs medical treatment, $13 896 per QALY for tube insertion vs medical  treatment, and $29 055 per QALY for tube insertion vs trabeculectomy. The  cost-effectiveness of each surgical procedure was most sensitive to early and late  surgical failure rates and was minimally affected by adverse events, rates of visual  field progression, or medication costs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assuming a  willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY, trabeculectomy and tube insertion are  cost-effective compared with medical treatment alone. Trabeculectomy, however, is  cost-effective at a substantially lower cost per QALY compared with tube insertion.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective/prospective cohort study of 789  heroin-using adults in a catchment area, collecting data on their usage of medical  care, including inpatient care, emergency visits, and outpatient care, in a 2-year  observation period. We interviewed and reviewed the medical records of 789 heroin  users in a methadone clinic of a general hospital in a rural area of Taiwan. The  demographic data, records of service use, diagnoses, and information on viral  infection status from Jan. 1, 2007 to Dec. 31, 2008 were collected. Most patients  were middle-aged and unemployed, had a basic educatiol level, and began their  first heroin use in their twenties. RESULTS: The health service utilization of  heroin users was mostly for infectious diseases, orthopedic conditions, and  gastroenterological disorders mainly due to blood-borne or local infections and  traumatic injury. Heroin users utilize fewer outpatient or inpatient services, but  more emergency care than the general public. The major correlates of inpatient and  emergency service utilization were HIV status and education level.

The objective of the present study was to  assess, among patients with NVAF, the effects of rivaroxaban versus warfarin on the  number of hospitalization days and other health care resource utilization in a  cohort of rivaroxaban users and matched warfarin users. METHODS: Data from health  care claims dated from May 2011 to December 2012 from the Huma database were  alyzed. Adult patients newly initiated on treatment with rivaroxaban or warfarin,  with ≥2 diagnoses of AF (ICD-9-CM code 427.31), and without valvular AF were  identified. Based on propensity score methods, warfarin recipients were matched 1:1  to rivaroxaban recipients. The end of the observation period was defined as the end  of data availability, the end of insurance coverage, death, the date of a switch to  another anticoagulant agent, or day 14 of treatment nonpersistence. The total number  of hospitalization days and other health care resource utilization parameters  (numbers of hospitalizations, emergency department [ED] visits, and outpatient  visits) were evaluated using the method by Lin et al. FINDINGS: Matches for all  rivaroxaban recipients were found, and the characteristics of the matched groups (n  = 2253 per group) were well balanced. The mean age of both cohorts was 74 years; 46%  were female.

METHODS: Using the Medicaid  Alytic eXtract database for the years 2000-2006, we identified patients ages 18-64  years who had SLE and the subset who had LN. We ascertained cases of serious  hospitalized infections using validated algorithms, and we determined 30-day  mortality rates. Poisson regression was used to calculate infection incidence rates  and multivariable Cox proportiol hazards models were used to calculate hazard  ratios (HRs) for the first infection, adjusted for sociodemographic variables,  medication use, and an SLE-specific risk adjustment index. RESULTS: We identified  33,565 patients with SLE, 7,113 of whom had LN. There were 9,078 serious infections  in 5,078 SLE patients and 3,494 infections in 1,825 LN patients.

This replaced a guideline to start aperients after 24h of enteral nutrition  if no bowel action had occurred. We sought to determine the effect of this change on  the incidence of diarrhoea and constipation in intensive care. METHODS:  Retrospective audit of the medical records of consecutive adult patients admitted to  intensive care and given enteral nutrition, excluding those with a primary  gastrointestil system diagnosis, between Jan-Aug 2011 (the delayed group, n=175)  and Jan-Aug 2012 (the early group, n=175).

We  therefore studied what proportion of ischemic strokes in patients with atrial  fibrillation early after CABG surgery were potentially preventable by  anticoagulation with warfarin. METHODS: We reviewed medical records from 2264  patients with isolated CABG performed during a period when our institution had no  policy on anticoagulation for postoperative atrial fibrillation. The outcome was  ischemic stroke within 30days postoperatively and verified with computed tomography  (CT) in patients with new postoperative atrial fibrillation for more than 48h.  RESULTS: New, postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 403 (17.8%) of the  patients and 191 of those (47.4%) were not started on warfarin at 48hours. Eight  patients developed CT-verified ischemic stroke, which occurred on postoperative day  1-3 in 4 patients and in 3 patients was of the lacur type. In two patients (stroke  day 25 and day 30) warfarin could have been preventive. In another patient with  onset of neurological symptoms on postoperative day 8 (4days from onset of the  arrhythmia), systemic anticoagulation might have limited the severity of the stroke  but warfarin therapy would not likely have reached therapeutic levels within 2days.

This US claims alysis evaluated, from  a US health plan perspective, patterns of total direct costs of care from treatment  initiation to progression for patients with MM treated with novel agents, using time  to next therapy (TTNT) as a proxy measure for progression. METHODS: A retrospective  study was conducted using a large US claims database, evaluating patients with  claims for MM between 2006 and 2013. Patients with claims for stem cell transplant  (SCT) were excluded. The alysis focused on patients receiving lelidomide (LEN)  or bortezomib (BORT) based treatment, for whom complete claim history was available  through initiation of subsequent treatment. Average patient monthly direct costs  were determined, including medical and pharmacy costs, and total cost patterns over  quarterly time periods were calculated. RESULTS: The study population comprised 2843  patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) and 1361 with relapsed MM. Total monthly  cost for patients with NDMM declined steadily, from $15,734 initially to $5082 at  18+ months after therapy. Upon initiation of second-line therapy, total monthly  costs rose to $13,876 and declined to $6446 18 months later. Although NDMM cost  levels for individual ordil months were similar between the LEN and BORT groups,  TTNT was longer for LEN-based treatments (37 months). The BORT-treated cohort had  higher average monthly total costs for NDMM and for the common time period through  37 months after initiation of therapy ($7534 vs $10,763 for LEN and BORT,  respectively). Key limitations of this study, in addition to the lack of mortality  and staging information available from claims data, include the definition of TTNT  based on change in treatment or a defined gap in therapy prior to retreatment, which  may differ from actual time of progression in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: For  patients with NDMM receiving either LEN- or BORT-based treatment without SCT,  followed until TTNT, total direct monthly costs (drugu2009+u2009medical) declined steadily  over time. Monthly costs returned to near initial levels when patients began  second-line therapy and then followed a similar pattern of decline.

However, there have been  relatively few studies with children and adolescents. Also, an appropriate dosage  has yet to be determined. AIM: This study investigated the safety and the efficacy  of levetiracetam for intravenous treatment of convulsive status epilepticus and  acute repetitive seizures in children and adolescents. METHOD: Retrospectively, the  study reviewed the medical records of 19 male and 31 female patients under 18 years  of age who had received intravenous levetiracetam treatment either for acute  repetitive seizures or for convulsive status epilepticus. The patients were admitted  between April 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2011 to the Department of Pediatrics,  Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.  Data were collected on underlying illnesses, etiology of seizures, indication for  levetiracetam therapy, initial dosage, rate of infusion, untoward effects during  infusion and emerged complications. Efficacy of treatment was defined as the  termition of seizure within 30 min of completing levetiracetam infusion and no  seizure recurrence within 6 h of initial treatment. RESULTS: The age range of the 50  patients was from one day to 18 years (mean 79.6 months). The alysis included 52  episodes of 34 acute repetitive seizures (63.4%) and 18 convulsive status  epilepticus (34.6%). Infusion rates ranged from 2 to 66 mg/kg/min (mean 29.6).  Cessation of seizure was obtained in 59.6% of 52 episodes. Patients with underlying  drug resistant epilepsy did not respond to levetiracetam therapy as well as patients  with other etiology of seizures. There were no adverse drug reactions or untoward  effects observed during the therapy. CONCLUSION: Intravenous administration of  levetiracetam is safe and effective for treatment of acute repetitive seizures and  convulsive status epilepticus in children and adolescents. Failure of treatment may  be related to underlying drug resistant epilepsy. Further study of appropriate  initial dosage and pharmacokinetic variations in the patients is needed as possible  explation of the unresponsiveness.', NULL, 0);

A sequela of the increase in opioid  abuse has been an increase in the number of infants born with opioid dependence.  These infants often require costly, prolonged stays in the neotal intensive care  unit (NICU) for drug withdrawal treatment. The authors studied a population of  infants from a large Medicaid health plan who were born with neotal abstinence  syndrome (S) secondary to in utero opioid exposure to assess the average length of  stay in the NICU, and to determine the variables that may account for differences in  interinstitutiol lengths of stay. The overall average length of stay for S was  21.1 days for the 139 infants included in the study. Alysis of the medication used  for treatment revealed that infants who were treated with a combined  inpatient/outpatient regimen with methadone had an average length of stay of 11.4  days versus 25.1 days for infants who were treated entirely as inpatients (P<0.001),  a 55% reduction in average length of stay. In 2009 there were an estimated 13,600  cases of S in the United States at a cost of $53,000 per case. A 55% reduction in  length of stay corresponds to $396 million in annual savings for the treatment of  S.

The recent addition of 2 direct-acting antiviral (DAA) protease inhibitors,  telaprevir and boceprevir, to peginterferon alfa (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy  has been shown to significantly improve sustained virologic response rates and thus  has become standard of care. While the efficacy and safety of DAAs has been assessed  in the clinical trial setting, less is known about real-world use of these new  therapies. OBJECTIVES: To (a) evaluate the treatment patterns, health care  utilization, and costs of CHC patients receiving DAA-based therapies in the United  States using a retrospective alysis of a large administrative claims database and  (b) evaluate factors associated with therapy noncompletion using multivariable  alyses. METHODS: Adult patients with ≥u20091 claim for CHC and a prescription filled  for boceprevir or telaprevir were selected from a de-identified U.S.-based claims  database. The date of the first fill for a DAA after May 13, 2011 (date of first DAA  availability) was defined as the index date, and patients were categorized into  either the telaprevir or boceprevir cohort. Patients were required to have  continuous eligibility and no claims for hepatitis B during the 6 months before  (baseline) and 12 months following (study period) the index date. Baseline  characteristics and study period treatment patterns, health care utilization, and  costs were described. Factors associated with therapy noncompletion were examined  using multivariable logistic regression, and adjusted health care costs were  compared between the DAA cohorts using multivariable alyses. RESULTS: A total of  871 telaprevir and 284 boceprevir patients were identified. DAA patients were aged  54 years on average and more often were male (60%, nu2009=u2009688). Approximately 25%  (nu2009=u2009216) of telaprevir and 18% (nu2009=u200952) of boceprevir patients had cirrhosis, and  9% (nu2009=u200982) of telaprevir and 7% (nu2009=u200920) of boceprevir patients had decompensated  cirrhosis at baseline. Less than 1% (nu2009=u20099) of patients were HIV co-infected.  Approximately 54% (nu2009=u2009470) of telaprevir and 74% (nu2009=u2009210) of boceprevir patients  did not complete the minimum duration of therapy as per the prescribing information  (telaprevir: 12 weeks of tripleu2009+u200912 weeks of dual; boceprevir: 3 weeks of  lead-inu2009+u200924 weeks of triple). In multivariable alyses, females (vs. males) and  patients taking boceprevir (vs. telaprevir) were more likely to not complete therapy  (Pu2009=u20090.011). CHC patients experienced high medical and drug-related resource  utilization. Telaprevir patients had numerically higher study period udjusted  medical (boceprevir: $16,927; telaprevir: $19,519) and drug costs (boceprevir:  $59,953; telaprevir: $76,497) than boceprevir patients; however, after adjusting for  baseline characteristics, only drug costs remained significantly different (Pu2009 less  than u20090.001).xa0 CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a large proportion of CHC  patients receiving telaprevir or boceprevir did not complete minimum duration of  therapy as per the prescribing information.

METHODS: Average wholesale price of commonly used CLL treatment regimens was  ascertained from tiol registries. Using the population of Olmsted County,  Minnesota, we identified the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed CLL who  experience progression to the point of requiring treatment. Using these data, total  pharmaceutical cost over a 10-year period after diagnosis was estimated for a  hypothetic cohort of 100 newly diagnosed patients under three scerios: before  approval of ibrutinib and idelalisib (historical scerio), after approval of  ibrutinib and idelalisib as salvage therapy (current scerios A and B), and  assuming use of ibrutinib as first-line treatment (potential future scerio).  RESULTS: Estimated 10-year pharmaceutical costs for 100 newly diagnosed patients  were as follows: $4,565,929 (approximately $45,659 per newly diagnosed patient and  $157,446 per treated patient) for the historical scerio, $7,794,843 (approximately  $77,948 per newly diagnosed patient and $268,788 per treated patient) for current  scerio A, $6,309,162 (approximately $63,092 per newly diagnosed patient and  $217,557 per treated patient) for current scerio B, and $16,414,055 (approximately  $164,141 per newly diagnosed patient and $566,002 per treated patient) for the  potential future scerio.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine boys and 19 girls with a mean ± SD age of 6.4xa0±xa02.18  years were randomly divided into group 1-parasacral transcutaneous electrical  stimulation with placebo drug and group 2-oxybutynin with sham scapular electrical  therapy. Success was assessed by 1) the rate of complete symptom resolution, 2) a  visual alog scale of 0 to 10, 3) the dysfunctiol voiding score system, 4)  voiding diary records, 5) Rome III criteria and 6) side effect frequency in each  group. RESULTS: A total of 13 and 15 patients were randomized to groups 1 and 2,  respectively. Symptoms completely resolved in 6 patients in group 1 (46%) and 3xa0in  group 2 (20%) (p = 0.204). A statistically significant improvement was found in the  2 groups in the dysfunctiol voiding score system and voiding diary records.  However, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups in the  visual alog scale score, voiding frequency, and maximum and mean voided volume (p  = 0.295, 0.098, 0.538 and 0.650, respectively).

The aim of this study was to  assess the effects of intraocular pressure in a cohort of patients from a real-life  clinical practice. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed on the clinical  records of patients treated with Ozurdex in Hospital Universitario Cruces in a 6  month period. The following variables were recorded: age, gender, diagnosis and  history of glaucoma; intraocular pressure, antihypertensive treatment and macular  thickness were recorded before the injection, and in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th  months after the injection. STATISTICAL TESTS: Mann-Whitney U test, Chi square test  (with Fisher correction when needed) and Wilcoxon test. The level of statistical  significance was set at P<.05.

STUDY DESIGN:  Retrospective chart review of 4698 women attending a New Zealand public hospital  abortion clinic over 2 years (2010-2012) to describe postabortion contraceptive  choice, with follow-up via clinic and tiol births records to assess subsequent  pregncies at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. RESULTS: Twenty percent of the cohort  (934/4698) received an implant, 26% an intrauterine method (927 copper intrauterine  device, 301 levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system [LNG-IUS]), and 54% chose  other shorter-acting methods (2536/4698). Method choice was significantly associated  with age, ethnicity, and pregncy history (p < .001). At 24 months, the udjusted  incidence of subsequent abortion for implant users was 3.8% (95% confidence interval  [CI] = 2.5-5.0) and 11.6% (95% CI = 10.3-12.8) for those choosing other short-acting  methods. By 48 months, 6.6% of implant users had a subsequent abortion (compared  with 18.3% for short-acting methods). The incidence of continued pregncy at 24  months was 6.3% (95% CI = 4.4-8.1) for implant users and 15.7% (95% CI = 14-17.2)  for those choosing other short-acting methods. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for  subsequent abortion were lowest for women initiating an implant (HR = 0.26, 95% CI =  0.20-0.35) or LNG-IUS (HR = 0.26, 0.16-0.44, reference group: short-acting methods).  CONCLUSIONS: Immediate postabortion insertion of an implant significantly reduced  rates of subsequent pregncy for at least 2 years. Abortion service providers  should ensure women have barrier-free access to all long-acting reversible  contraceptions to delay or prevent pregncy. IMPLICATIONS: Initiation of an  levonorgestrel implant immediately postabortion was associated with a 74% reduction  in subsequent abortion over the next 4 years compared with use of short-acting  methods.

However, there are limited data on the  effectiveness of glyburide when compared with insulin as used in a real-world  setting. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of adverse materl and neotal outcomes  in women with GDM treated with glyburide compared with insulin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of a population-based cohort from a  tionwide US employer-based insurance claims database from January 1, 2000, to  December 31, 2011. We identified women with GDM and their newborns. We excluded  those with type 1 or 2 diabetes and those younger than 15 years or older than 45  years. EXPOSURES: Treatment with glyburide or insulin during pregncy within 150  days before delivery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We used binomial regression to  estimate risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences with 95% confidence intervals for  the association of glyburide with diagnosis codes for obstetric trauma, cesarean  delivery, birth injury, preterm birth, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, jaundice,  large for gestatiol age, and hospitalization in the neotal intensive care unit.

This study examines how adherence and  persistence to once-daily liraglutide impact glycemic control and economic outcomes  in a real-world population of adult type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. METHODS: A  retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data from July 2009 through  September 2013. Patients aged ≥18 years with T2D treated with liraglutide were  identified (index date = first liraglutide prescription). Adherence was based on the  proportion of days covered (PDC); with PDC ≥0.80 classified as adherent.  Non-persistent patients were those with a gap in therapy of >90 days. Lab results  for glycated hemoglobin (A1C) were used to identify whether patients achieved target  levels of <7.0% and ≤ 6.5%, or experienced a reduction of ≥1.0% in A1C from  pre-index (baseline) to post-index (follow-up). Logistic regression was used to  estimate the likelihood of achieving the A1C goals, adjusted for baseline  characteristics. Diabetes-related medical, pharmacy, and total costs were modeled  and estimated for the adherence and persistence cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 1321  patients were identified. The mean PDC was 0.59 and 34% of patients were classified  as adherent, while 60% were persistent over 12 months of follow-up. Adherent and  persistent patients were more likely to achieve each of the A1C goals than their  non-adherent and non-persistent counterparts after adjusting for patient  characteristics.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors  associated with longterm changes in BMI. METHODS: Subjects with RA from the Veterans  Affairs (VA) Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) Registry (n = 1474) were studied.  Information on inflammatory markers, presence of erosions, and smoking status were  extracted from the VARA database. BMI was extracted from VA electronic medical  records within 14 days of each visit date. VA pharmacy records were queried to  identify prescriptions for specific RA therapies within 1 month of the visit date.  We used robust generalized estimating equations margil regression models to  calculate independent associations between clinical variables and BMI over time.  Similar models determined predictors of change in weight and risk of weight loss  over the subsequent study observation period. RESULTS: Increasing age, active  smoking, and the presence of erosions at baseline were associated with lower BMI.  Weight decreased over time among older adults. Factors associated with greater  reductions in BMI over time and a greater risk of weight loss were higher  inflammatory markers, smoking, older age, higher BMI, and less subsequent  improvement in inflammation. Methotrexate use was associated with a lower risk of  weight loss. The use of prednisone or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies was not  associated with change in BMI or the risk of weight loss independent of other  factors. CONCLUSION: Greater age, greater inflammatory activity, and active smoking  are associated with greater weight loss in RA over time.FAU - Baker, Joshua FAU - Baker JFAD - From the Division of Rheumatology, and Center for Health Equity Research and  Promotion, Philadelphia Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center; Division of  Rheumatology, and Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of  Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Salt Lake City VA  Medical Center and University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; Department of Medicine,  Denver VA Medical Center, Denver, Colorado; Department of Medicine, Nebraska-Western  Iowa VA Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.J.F.

Although metabolic adverse effects have been linked to SGA use in  youths, estimating the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, a rarer outcome, has been  challenging. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether SGA initiation was associated with an  increased risk for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary alyses examined  the risk associated with multiple-drug regimens, including stimulants and  antidepressants, as well as individual SGAs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:  Retrospective tiol cohort study of Medicaid-enrolled youths between January 2003  and December 2007. In this observatiol study using tiol Medicaid Alytic  eXtract data files, initiators and noninitiators of SGAs were identified in each  month. Included in this study were US youths aged 10 to 18 years with a mental  health diagnosis and enrolled in a Medicaid fee-for-service arrangement during the  study. Those with chronic steroid exposure, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or SGA  use during a 1-year look-back period were ineligible. The mean follow-up time for  all participants was 17.2 months. Youths were followed up until diagnosis of  diabetes mellitus or end of follow-up owing to censoring caused by the transition  into a Medicaid maged care arrangement or Medicaid ineligibility (the end of  available data). Propensity weights were developed to balance observed demographic  and clinical characteristics between exposure groups. Discrete failure time models  were fitted using weighted logistic regression to estimate the risk for incident  diabetes mellitus between initiators and noninitiators. EXPOSURE: A filled SGA  prescription. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident type 2 diabetes mellitus  identified through visit and pharmacy claims during the observation period. RESULTS:  Among 107,551 SGA initiators and 1,221,434 noninitiators, the risk for incident  diabetes mellitus was increased among initiators (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% CI,  1.35-1.69; Pu2009<u2009.001). Compared with youths initiating only SGAs, the risk was higher  among SGA initiators who used antidepressants concomitantly at the time of SGA  initiation (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.17-2.03; Pu2009=u2009.002) but was not significantly  different for SGA initiators who were concomitantly using stimulants. As compared  with a reference group of risperidone initiators, the risk was higher among those  initiating ziprasidone (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.99-2.64; Pu2009=u2009.06) and aripiprazole (OR,  1.58; 95% CI, 1.21-2.07; Pu2009=u2009.001) but not quetiapine fumarate or olanzapine.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The risk for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus was  increased among youths initiating SGAs and was highest in those concomitantly using  antidepressants.

STUDY DESIGN: The records of 301 consecutive women  who underwent MTOP between July 2010 and July 2011 were studied retrospectively. The  follow-up protocol included ultrasound evaluation 2 weeks after MTOP. Surgical  termition was offered when pregncy was found to be ongoing, and either  hysteroscopy/curettage or a repeat ultrasound 2 weeks later was offered when the  ultrasound findings were suspicious for retained products of conception.

The purpose  of this article is to provide a factual basis for evaluating the claims regarding  the benefits of Sovaldi® relative to its costs. METHODS: A comprehensive review was  conducted of news stories highlighted in the daily updates of the electronic  newsletters BIO SmartBrief, FiercePharma, FierceBiotech and BioCentury Extra  published from November 1, 2013, through December 31, 2014, on the topics of the HCV  market, Sovaldi®, and other HCV therapeutics. Also reviewed were recent practice  guidelines on the magement of HCV infections, prescribing information on all HCV  drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and health technology  assessments of Sovaldi® and Harvoni(TM) (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir). FINDINGS: Sovaldi®  and Harvoni(TM) have provided significant improvements in the treatment of HCV, with  all-oral regimens and cure rates exceeding 90% in some populations of patients with  HCV. Sovaldi® prevents significant health care resource utilization in patients who  would otherwise develop cirrhosis and require a liver transplant; however, only a  small proportion of patients with HCV develop cirrhosis, and fewer require liver  transplants. Because it is not possible to identify those patients whose HCV will  progress to severe liver disease, it would be necessary to treat a large number of  patients with HCV to prevent disease progression in this subpopulation, resulting in  a considerable loss to health plans even over a 20-year horizon. The claim that  treating all patients with HCV with Sovaldi® would cost nearly as much as the  current total US expenditure on all prescription drugs, while factually correct, is  not a realistic scerio. Many patients with HCV will continue to go undiagnosed. In  addition, the medical expense for those who are treated will be spread out over many  years. However, the unexpectedly large, up-front cost of covering these drugs has  had a major impact on health plan budgets, resulting in losses for some plans.  IMPLICATIONS: Sovaldi® represents an enormous advance in the care of some  populations of HCV-infected patients, but also a major cost burden to health plans.  As the first of a number of anticipated, paradigm-changing drugs to treat medical  conditions affecting large patient populations, Sovaldi® should act as a wake-up  call for all health care stakeholders to engage in a meaningful, fact-based  discussion about maging the cost of innovative new drugs to balance the needs of  drug manufacturers, health plans, providers, and, above all, patients.', NULL, 0);

Recent retrospective  studies demonstrated that treatment with the sublingual film formulation is  associated with improved treatment retention and lower healthcare costs. In March  2013, generic buprenorphine/loxone tablets were approved in the US. A budget  impact model was built to compare healthcare expenditures for different market  shares of sublingual film and tablet. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to track  a cohort of opioid dependent patients treated with sublingual film or tablet through  the following treatment phases: initiation, maintence, discontinuation,  off-treatment and reinitiation. Transition probabilities and costs for each phase  were estimated from the MarketScan Medicaid database for the period between 1 March  2010 and 30 June 2012. The total expenditure for the plan and expenditure per plan  member per month were predicted over 5 years. Two market share scerios were  considered: 1) sublingual film is progressively replaced by generic tablet (current  situation) and 2) the sublingual film holds a market share of 100%. RESULTS:  Predicted total costs over 5 years were $6400 million when the sublingual film holds  a market share of 100% (as per Scerio 2) which is lower than when sublingual film  is progressively replaced by generic tablet (current situation as per Scerio 1) by  $64 million. These savings were mostly driven by inpatient care ($56 million saved  over 5 years), followed by emergency room care ($27 million) and pharmaceutical  costs ($24 million). Costs of outpatient care attenuated the difference as they were  predicted to be higher by $44 million in Scerio 2. The reduction in total cost per  member per month reached $0.027 in the fifth year. Results were most sensitive to  price rebates and to the probability of non-psychiatric hospitalization.  CONCLUSIONS: While using the sublingual film formulation for more patients treated  with buprenorphine/loxone is predicted to increase outpatient care costs, it would  generate savings in emergency care and hospitalizations. In the treatment of opioid  dependence, total direct medical costs for Medicaid would be lower for sublingual  film treated patients, at current drug prices.FAU - Asche, Carl VAU - Asche CVAD - a a University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria/University of Illinois at  Chicago College of Pharmacy , Peoria , IL , USA.FAU - Clay, EmilieAU - Clay EAD - b b Creativ-Ceutical , Paris , France.FAU - Kharitonova, ElizavetaAU - Kharitonova EAD - c c Creativ-Ceutical , Chicago , IL , USA.FAU - Zah, VladimirAU - Zah VAD - d d ZRx Outcomes Research Inc. , Mississauga , ON , Cada.FAU - Ruby, JaneAU - Ruby JAD - e e Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Richmond , VA , USA.', NULL, 0);

Thus, annual surveillance may be  excessive. We hypothesized that less frequent postoperative surveillance in these  patients is cost effective. METHODS: A Markov discrete time state transition model  was created to compare postoperative surveillance tapered to 3-year intervals after  5 years of annual surveillance versus conventiol annual surveillance in low-risk  PTC patients with negative neck ultrasound and stimulated thyroglobulin less than  2u2009ng/mL 1 year postoperatively. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were  determined via literature review, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, and  Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data. Sensitivity alyses were performed to  assess areas of uncertainty. RESULTS: The cost of annual surveillance was $5,239 per  patient and yielded 22.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The 3-year strategy  cost $2,601 less, but also yielded 0.01 less QALYs. Thus, the incremental cost per  QALY of annual surveillance was $260,100. Probabilistic sensitivity alysis  demonstrated that less frequent surveillance was more cost effective in 99.98% of  10,000 simulated patients. One-way sensitivity alysis revealed that annual  surveillance would be cost effective if the total cost of neck ultrasound could be  reduced to $23 or less.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively alyzed the  records of 225 patients who underwent combined androgen blockade as first line  therapy for prostate cancer. The prognostic values of testosterone and other  clinical factors were evaluated with respect to prostate specific antigen  progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Median patient age was 73.0 years,  median prostate specific antigen was 42.6 ng/ml and median followup was 45.8 months.  No variable associated with testosterone was predictive of progression-free  survival. With regard to overall survival on univariate alysis dir testosterone  less than 16 ng/dl (pxa0=xa00.0190), less than 20 ng/dl (p = 0.0020) and less than 32  ng/dl (p = 0.0146) were significant together with other clinical factors. In  contrast, dir testosterone less than 8 and less than 12 ng/dl were not  significant. Multivariate alysis showed that dir testosterone less than 20 ng/dl  was the significant prognostic factor (p = 0.0048). In addition, time to dir  testosterone was about 1xa0year (11.3xa0months). Patients were divided into rapid and  slow types based on time to testosterone less than 20 ng/dl before and after 6  months, respectively. No significant difference in overall survival was observed  between the 2 types. The current results suggest that the critical factor for  prognosis was not a rapid decrease but whether dir testosterone achieved a level  of less than 20 ng/dl. CONCLUSIONS: dir testosterone 20 ng/dl was the most  significant cutoff level for overall survival in Japanese patients with prostate  cancer treated with combined androgen blockade.', NULL, 225);

Little is known about their real-world  comparative effectiveness and safety, even less among patient demographic and  clinical subgroups. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a cohort of non-valvular AF patients  initiating anticoagulation from October 2010 to December 2012 drawn from a large US  database of commercial and Medicare supplement claims, we applied propensity score  weights to Cox proportiol hazards regression to assess the comparative  effectiveness and safety of dabigatran versus warfarin. Alyses were repeated among  clinical and demographic subgroups using stratum-specific propensity scores as an  exploratory alysis. Of the 64 935 patients initiating anticoagulation, 32.5% used  dabigatran. Compared with warfarin, dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of  ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (composite adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR], 95% CI:  0.86, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.93), hemorrhagic stroke (aHR: 0.51, 0.40 to 0.65), and acute  myocardial infarction (aHR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.77 to 0.99), and no relation was seen  between dabigatran and the composite harm outcome (aHR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.01).  However, dabigatran was associated with a higher risk of gastrointestil bleeding  (aHR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.22). Estimates of effectiveness and safety appeared to  be mostly similar across subgroups.

We also aimed to explore the effects of neighborhood deprivation on  the relationship between CHADS2 risk score and warfarin prescription. METHODS: Data  were obtained from primary health care records that contained individual clinical  data that were linked to tiol data on neighborhood of residence and a  deprivation index for different neighborhoods. Logistic regression was used to  estimate the potential neighborhood differences in prescribed warfarin, aspirin and  statins, and the association between the CHADS2 score and prescribed warfarin  treatment, in neighborhoods with high, middle (referent) and low socio-economic  (SES). RESULTS: After adjustment for age, socio-economic factors, co-morbidities and  moves to neighborhoods with different SES during follow-up, adults with AF living in  high SES neighborhoods were more often prescribed warfarin (men odds ratio (OR) (95%  confidence interval (CI): 1.44 (1.27-1.62); and women OR (95% CI): 1.19 (1.05-1.36))  and statins (men OR (95% CI): 1.23 (1.07-1.41); women OR (95% CI): 1.23 (1.05-1.44))  compared to their counterparts residing in middle SES.

METHODS: This was a retrospective  cohort study that used a United States (US) claims database. The study period was  from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2011. The index date was the date of the first  oral bisphosphote (alendrote, ibandrote, or risedrote) prescription and  occurred between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010. The pre- and post-index  periods were the 1-year periods before and after the index date, respectively. The  alysis included women with osteoporosis aged ≥55 years at the index date who were  ive to all osteoporosis treatments before the index date and were continuously  enrolled in the health plan for at least 1 year before and 1 year after the index  date. Patients with a diagnosis of malignt neoplasm during the pre- or post-index  periods or a diagnosis of Paget disease anytime in the claims history were excluded.  The occurrence of GI events (defined as esophagitis; gastroesophageal reflux  disease; ulcer, stricture, perforation, or hemorrhage of the esophagus; gastric,  duodel, or peptic ulcer; acute gastritis; duodenitis; GI hemorrhage;  usea/vomiting; or dysphagia) was assessed during the pre-index period and at 3, 6,  and 12 months in the post-index period. The rate of GI events was defined as the  percentage of patients having at least 1 GI event in each alysis period (ie,  pre-index and post-index periods). GI events in the post-index period were also  stratified by the presence of GI events in the pre-index period. FINDINGS: A total  of 75,593 women were included in the alysis. The average age at the index date was  64.4 years. Gastroprotective agents were used by 17.9% of patients. Approximately  one fourth of patients (26.6%; n = 20,073) had ≥1 GI events in the pre-index period.  Approximately the same proportion of patients (28.0%; n = 21,142) experienced GI  events in the post-index period. The cumulative rate of GI events during the  post-index period was higher among patients who had GI events in the pre-index  period (51.2%) than among patients without a GI event in the pre-index period  (19.6%). IMPLICATIONS: Among women with osteoporosis enrolled in a US commercial  plan, GI events were common regardless of bisphosphote use.

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MDS from 2001 to 2005  were identified in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked  database. The study cohort consisted of patients with new-onset transfusion  dependence (TD). All patients received an ESA at least once during the study period,  which began the week that criteria for TD were met and continued until transfusion  independence (TI). Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox Proportiol Hazard models were  used to assess relationships between time to ESA initiation, agent and number of  weeks of ESA use and TI attainment. RESULTS: Of 610 TD patients treated with ESAs,  210 (34.4%) achieved TI. Median time from ESA initiation to TI was 13 weeks. Shorter  time from TD to ESA initiation and use of darbepoetin were associated with higher  probability of achieving TI.

METHODS: We  undertook a retrospective cohort study, examining the relationship between vitamin K  administration and immunisation uptake by parents of babies born over a 2-year  period (January 2010-December 2011) in Dunedin, New Zealand (NZ). Both written and  electronic data from a single birthing unit and the NZ tiol Immunisation  Register (NIR) were alysed to ascertain the relationship between declining newborn  vitamin K prophylaxis and subsequent immunisation uptake. RESULTS: Records for 3575  babies were examined. Ninety-two per cent of infants received intramuscular, and 5%  received oral vitamin K. An increased risk ratio for non-immunisation of 14.1 (95%  confidence interval 7.8-25.9) for babies whose parents declined vitamin K was  identified. Receiving oral vitamin K was also associated with subsequent  non-immunisation, with a risk ratio of 3.5 (95% confidence interval 1.7-7.3).

Study protocol  for a randomized controlled trial', 'BACKGROUND: This document describes a research protocol for a study designed to  estimate the impact of implementing a reminder system for medical providers on the  use of isoniazid preventative therapy (IPT) for adults living with HIV in western  Kenya. People living with HIV have a 5% to 10% annual risk of developing active  tuberculosis (TB) once infected with TB bacilli, compared to a 5% lifetime risk in  HIV-negative people with latent TB infection. Moreover, people living with HIV have  a 20-fold higher risk of dying from TB. A growing body of literature suggests that  IPT reduces overall TB incidence and is therefore of considerable benefit to  patients and the larger community. However, in 2009, of the estimated 33 million  people living with HIV, only 1.7 million (5%) were screened for TB, and about 85,000  (0.2%) were offered IPT. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will examine the use of clinical  decision-support reminders to improve rates of initiation of preventative treatment  in a TB/HIV co-morbid population living in a TB endemic area. This will be a  pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster-randomized superiority trial with a 1:1  allocation to treatment ratio.

All HIV-positive adult patients who complete an initial  encounter at a study cluster and at least one return encounter during the study  period will be included in the study cohort. The primary endpoint will be IPT  prescription at 3 months post the initial encounter. We will conduct both  individual-level and cluster-level alyses. Due to the ture of the intervention,  the trial will not be blinded. This study will contribute to the growing evidence  base for the use of electronic health interventions in low-resource settings to  promote high-quality clinical care, health system optimization and positive patient  outcomes.

The purpose of this  retrospective study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous  sclerotherapy with doxycycline and 3% Sotradecol as primary treatment for pediatric  head and neck LMs, and to assess outcomes based on lesion classification, location  and sclerosant used. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a single center, retrospective,  case series study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 38 children who  underwent percutaneous sclerotherapy of LMs in the head and neck region at our  tertiary care center between 1/1/2006 and 1/31/2011 were reviewed. A mean average of  2.9 (range 1-10) sclerotherapy sessions per child were performed. LMs involved  primarily the face (61.3%), posterior neck (48.4%), submental area (45.2%), and  anterior neck (35.5%). RESULTS: Twenty-nine subjects had adequate follow-up data,  with 51.7% demonstrating complete resolution, 27.6% moderate improvement, and 20.7%  no response. There was no significant difference in the outcome based on the  sclerosant agent used or location of the lesion. Lesion type did affect outcome and  macrocystic lesions were found to have a significantly higher resolution rate  (95.2%) than microcystic or mixed lesions (p < 0.05). The total number of  complications was similar between agents and all were minor. CONCLUSION: Our results  indicate that percutaneous therapy with doxycycline and Sotradecol is safe and  effective for children with LMs of the head and neck. Better outcomes were observed  with macrocystic LMs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.', NULL, 0);

The aim of this study was to estimate influenza vaccine  effectiveness (VE) among individuals aged 60+ years over three seasons and to assess  if the screening method is a suitable tool to monitor influenza VE in this  particular target-group in Germany. METHODS: We identified laboratory-confirmed  influenza cases aged 60+ years through the tiol communicable disease reporting  system for seasons 2010/11, 2011/12 and 2012/13. Vaccition coverage (VC) data were  retrieved from a database of health insurance claims representing ~85% of the total  German population. We applied the screening method to calculate influenza  subtype-specific VE and compared our results with VE estimates from other  observatiol studies in Europe. RESULTS: In total, 7,156 laboratory-confirmed  influenza cases were included. VE against all influenza types ranged between 49%  (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39-56) in 2011/12 and 80% (95% CI: 76-83%) in  2010/11. In 2010/11 subtype-specific VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B was 76%  and 84%, respectively. In the following seasons, VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm,  A(H3N2) and B was 87%, -9% , 74% (2011/12), and 74%, 39%, 73% (2012/13). VE was  higher among hospitalized compared to non-hospitalized influenza A cases. Seventeen  observatiol studies from Europe reporting subtype-specific VE among the elderly  were identified for the respective seasons (all applying the test-negative design)  and showed comparable subtype-specific VE estimates. CONCLUSIONS: According to our  study, influenza vaccition provided moderate protection against  laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B in individuals aged 60+ but no or  only little protection against A(H3N2). Higher VE among hospitalized cases might  indicate higher protection against severe influenza disease. Based on the available  data, the screening method allowed us to assess subtype-specific VE in hospitalized  and non-hospitalized elderly persons. Since controlling for several important  confounders was not possible, the applied method only provided crude VE estimates.  However, given the precise VC-data and the large number of cases, the screening  method provided results being in line with VE estimates from other observatiol  studies in Europe that applied a different study design.FAU - Remschmidt, CorneliusAU - Remschmidt CAD - Immunization Unit, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.

The effect of these pharmaceutical market changes on  opioid dispensing and overdose rates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  association between 2 temporally proximate changes in the opioid market and opioid  dispensing and overdose rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Claims from a  large tiol US health insurer were alyzed, using an interrupted time series  study design. Participants included an open cohort of 31.3 million commercially  insured members aged 18 to 64 years between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012,  with median follow-up of 20 months (last follow-up, December 31, 2012). EXPOSURES:  Introduction of abuse-deterrent OxyContin (resistant to crushing or dissolving) on  August 9, 2010, and market withdrawal of propoxyphene on November 19, 2010. MAIN  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized opioid dispensing rates and prescription opioid  and heroin overdose rates were the primary outcomes. We used segmented regression to  alyze changes in outcomes from 30 quarters before to 8 quarters after the 2  interventions. RESULTS: Two years after the opioid market changes, total opioid  dispensing decreased by 19% from the expected rate (absolute change, -32.2 mg  morphine-equivalent dose per member per quarter [95% CI, -38.1 to -26.3]). By opioid  subtype, the absolute change in dispensing by milligrams of morphine-equivalent dose  per member per quarter at 2 years was -11.3 (95% CI, -12.4 to -10.1) for  extended-release oxycodone, 3.26 (95% CI, 1.40 to 5.12) for other long-acting  opioids, -8.19 (95% CI, -9.30 to -7.08) for propoxyphene, and -16.2 (95% CI, -18.8  to -13.5) for other immediate-release opioids. Two years after the market changes,  the estimated overdose rate attributed to prescription opioids decreased by 20%  (absolute change, -1.10 per 100,000 members per quarter [95% CI, -1.47 to -0.74]),  but heroin overdose increased by 23% (absolute change, 0.26 per 100,000 members per  quarter [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.53]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Opioid dispensing and  prescription opioid overdoses decreased substantially after 2 major changes in the  pharmaceutical market in late 2010. Pharmaceutical market interventions may have  value in combatting the prescription opioid overdose epidemic, but heroin overdose  rates continue to increase.

This study examines HIV infection status as a  predictor of HCV R test receipt after an anti-HCV+ result in the primary care  setting. METHODS: Electronic medical records of anti-HCV+ patients from a multisite  retrospective study of patients aged ≥18 years who utilized one or more primary care  outpatient services during 2005-2010 were alyzed in 2014. A multivariable logistic  regression model examined the independent relationships between patient  characteristics and receipt of HCV R testing. RESULTS: Among 1,115 anti-HCV+  patients, 133 (11.9%) were also HIV-positive. Of these, 77.4% (n=103) underwent HCV  R testing to determine current infection status. By contrast, 66.7% (n=654/980) of  anti-HCV+ patients who were HIV-negative received HCV R testing. Following  multivariable adjustment, the odds of receiving HCV R testing were higher among  anti-HCV+ patients who were also HIV-positive (AOR=1.9, 95% CI=1.2, 3.0), compared  with their HIV-negative counterparts.

Eligible patients had a diagnosis of metastatic PC at age 18 years or  older between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012; had ≥3 months of follow-up  time beginning at metastatic diagnosis; and received at least 1 cancer-directed  therapy for metastatic disease. Information on patient demographics, Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, location of primary tumor, presence  of comorbidities, adverse events, and complications were collected. Data on  cancer-directed treatments and supportive care measures were evaluated. All alyses  were descriptive. FINDINGS: Approximately two thirds of patients were men, and  median age at metastatic disease diagnosis was 62.2 years. Nearly all patients  (97.3%) received chemotherapy to treat metastatic disease, 9.3% received radiation  therapy, and 7.8% received a targeted therapy. Overall, the most frequently  administered first-line regimens for metastatic disease were gemcitabine alone  (46.0%), a combition chemotherapy regimen consisting of oxaliplatin, irinotecan,  fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX; 20.1%); gemcitabine/capecitabine (10.8%);  and gemcitabine/oxaliplatin (9.5%). Approximately 40% of patients in France and 15%  of patients in the United Kingdom received second-line systemic therapy, whereas 20%  of patients in France and 3.4% of patients in the United Kingdom received third-line  systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Overall, 52.5% of patients experienced at  least one complication of PC. More than two thirds of patients had ≥1 office visit  unrelated to chemotherapy administration, 54.0% had ≥1 inpatient hospitalization,  36.8% had ≥1 emergency department visit, and 25.3% had ≥1 pain magement clinic  visit. A total of 26.5% of patients in France and 42.5% in the United Kingdom  entered hospice or long-term care. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides new, detailed  information for patients with metastatic PC in real-world settings in 2 European  countries. A small proportion of patients received >1 line of systemic therapy for  metastatic disease, which is likely due to the aggressiveness of this disease and  the lack of effective therapeutic options.', NULL, 400);

DESIGN: After 1-to-1 propensity score caliper matching, comparison  of submucosal epinephrine injection was performed with polidocanol injection.  SETTING: Endoscopic suite at the University of Foggia between 2005 and 2014.  PATIENTS: Of 711 patients who underwent endoscopic resection of colon sessile polyps  20 mm or larger, 612 were alyzed after matching. INTERVENTIONS: Submucosal  epinephrine injection in 306 patients and polidocanol injection in 306 patients.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  aimed at identifying independent predictors of postpolypectomy bleeding (PPB).  RESULTS: The 2 groups presented similar baseline clinical parameters and lesion  characteristics. All patients had a single polyp 20 mm or larger; the median size  was 32 mm (interquartile range [IQR], 25-38) in the polidocanol group and 32 (IQR,  24-38) in the epinephrine group (P=.7). Polidocanol was more effective in preventing  both immediate and delayed PPB (P<.001 and P=.003, respectively), and its efficacy  was confirmed in almost all of the subgroups, regardless of polyp size and  histology. Postprocedure perforation was observed in 2 patients (0.3%), both in the  epinephrine group (P=.49). The 2 groups did not differ in the number of sre  resections of lesions or the procedure duration (P=.24 and .6, respectively).  LIMITATIONS: Absence of randomization.

DESIGN: Retrospective, propensity matched cohort study. SETTING:  Optum Labs Data Warehouse, a large database including administrative claims data on  privately insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees. PARTICIPANTS: New users of  dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin from 1 November 2010 to 30 September 2013.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rates (events/100 patient years) and propensity  score matched Cox proportiol hazards models were used to estimate rates of total  gastrointestil bleeds, upper gastrointestil bleeds, and lower gastrointestil  bleeds for the novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in patients with and  without atrial fibrillation. Heterogeneity of treatment effect related to age was  examined using a margil effects model. RESULTS: The incidence of gastrointestil  bleeding associated with dabigatran was 2.29 (95% confidence interval 1.88 to 2.79)  per 100 patient years and that associated with warfarin was 2.87 (2.41 to 3.41) per  100 patient years in patients with atrial fibrillation.

In  propensity score matched models, the risk of gastrointestil bleeding with novel  oral anticoagulants was similar to that with warfarin in atrial fibrillation  patients (dabigatran v warfarin, hazard ratio 0.79 (0.61 to 1.03); rivaroxaban v  warfarin, 0.93 (0.69 to 1.25)) and in non-AF patients (dabigatran v warfarin, hazard  ratio 1.14 (0.54 to 2.39); rivaroxaban v warfarin, 0.89 (0.60 to 1.32)). The risk of  gastrointestil bleeding increased after age 65, such that by age 76 the risk  exceeded that with warfarin among atrial fibrillation patients taking dabigatran  (hazard ratio 2.49 (1.61 to 3.83)) and patients with and without atrial fibrillation  taking rivaroxaban (2.91 (1.65 to 4.81) and 4.58 (2.40 to 8.72), respectively).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective  cross-sectiol study to alyze patient characteristics who underwent the XBT for  evaluation of SIBO. Diagnostic testing with the XBT was performed based on a  clinical suspicion for SIBO in patients with symptoms of bloating, abdomil pain,  abdomil distension, weight loss, diarrhea, and/or constipation. Consecutive  electronic medical records of 932 patients who completed the XBT at the University  of Florida between 2005 and 2009 were reviewed. A two-way Alysis of Variance  (ANOVA) was used to test for several associations including age, gender, and body  mass index (BMI) with a +XBT. A two-way ANOVA was also performed to control for the  differences and interaction with age and between genders. A similar alysis was  repeated for BMI. Associations between medical conditions and prior surgical  histories were conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel method for 2 by 2 contingency  tables, stratified for gender. Reported odds ratio estimates reflect the odds of the  prevalence of a condition within the +XBT group to that of the -XBT group. P values  of less than 0.05 (two-sided) were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In  the 932 consecutive eligible subjects studied, 513 had a positive XBT. A positive  association was found between female gender and a positive XBT (P = 0.0025), and  females with a positive test were, on average, greater than 5 years older than those  with a negative test (P = 0.024). The mean BMI of positive XBT subjects was normal  (24.5) and significantly lower than the subjects with a negative XBT (29.5) (P =  0.0050). A positive XBT was associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)  (OR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.80, P = 0.04), peptic ulcer disease (PUD) (OR = 2.61;  95%CI: 1.48-4.59, P < 0.01), gastroparesis (GP) (OR = 2.04; 95%CI: 1.21-3.41, P <  0.01) and steroid use (OR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.80, P = 0.01). Irritable bowel  syndrome, independent proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) usage, or previous abdomil  surgery was not significantly associated with a positive XBT. No single subdivision  by gender or PPI use was associated with a significant difference in the odds ratios  between any of the subsets.

METHODS: Chronic PPI use is associated with masking of H. pylori infection. Patients  with H. pylori infection are predisposed to gastric and duodel ulcers, and  long-term infection with this organism has been associated with gastric mucosal  atrophy and serious long-term complications, such as gastric lymphoma and  adenocarcinoma. Three hundred patients diagnosed with gastritis between January 2008  and April 2010 were included in our study. The computerized medical database of  these patients was reviewed retrospectively in order to assess whether the type of  gastritis diagnosed (H. pylori vs non-H. pylori gastritis) is influenced by PPI  exposure. H. pylori density was graded as low, if corresponding to mild density  following the Updated Sydney System, or high, if corresponding to moderate or severe  densities in the Updated Sydney System. RESULTS: Patients were equally distributed  between males and females with a median age at the time of diagnosis of 50 years old  (range: 20-87). The histological types of gastritis were classified as H. pylori  gastritis (n = 156, 52%) and non-H. pylori gastritis (n = 144, 48%). All patients  with non-H. pylori gastritis had ictive chronic gastritis. Patients with no  previous PPI exposure were more likely to be diagnosed with H. pylori gastritis than  those with previous PPI exposure (71% vs 34.2%, P < 0.001). Intestil metaplasia  was more likely to be detected in the latter patients (1.4% vs 6.5%, P = 0.023).  Multivariate alysis has also demonstrated that in the presence of previous PPI  exposure (OR = 0.217, 95%CI: 0.123-0.385), GERD (OR = 0.317, 95%CI: 0.132-0.763, P =  0.01), alcohol intake (OR = 0.396, 95%CI: 0.195-0.804, P = 0.01), the detection of  H. pylori was less likely. Chronic use of PPIs may mask H. pylori infections  promoting the diagnosis of non-H. pylori gastritis and leads to a significant drop  in H. pylori densities and to an increased risk of intestil metaplasia.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to  investigate the seasol variation in BW in Denmark during 1936-1989, and to see if  the variation could be explained by sunshine exposure during pregncy. METHODS: The  study population was selected from the Copenhagen School Health Records Register and  included 276 339 children born between 1936 and 1989. Seasol variation was modeled  using a non-statiory sinusoidal model that allowed the underlying trend in BW and  the amplitude and phase of the yearly cycles to change. RESULTS: There was a clear  seasol pattern in BW which, however, changed gradually across the study period.  The highest BWs were seen during fall (September - October) from 1936 to 1963, but a  new peak gradually grew from the early 1940s during early summer (May - June) and  became the highest from 1964 to 1989.

Racial differences in fracture risk may be related to  differences in bioavailable vitamin D due to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  variations in the vitamin D binding protein (DBP). METHODS: We measured 25(OH)D  levels in 12,781 middle-aged White and Black participants [mean age 57 years (SD  5.7), 25% Black] in the ARIC Study who attended the second examition from  1990-1992. Participants were genotyped for two DBP SNPs (rs4588 and rs7041).  Incident hospitalized fractures were measured by abstracting hospital records for  ICD-9 codes. We used Cox proportiol hazards models to evaluate the association  between 25(OH)D levels and risk of fracture with adjustment for possible  confounders. Interactions were tested by race and DBP genotype. RESULTS: There were  1122 incident fracture-related hospitalizations including 267 hip fractures over a  median of 19.6 years of follow-up. Participants with deficient 25(OH)D (<20 ng/mL)  had a higher risk of any fracture hospitalization [HR=1.21 (95% CI 1.05-1.39)] and  hospitalization for hip fracture [HR=1.35 (1.02-1.79)]. No significant racial  interaction was noted (p-interaction=0.20 for any fracture; 0.74 for hip fracture).  There was no independent association of rs4588 and rs7041 with fracture.

CONCLUSIONS: Deficient 25(OH)D  levels are associated with higher incidence of hospitalized fractures.

Dialysis facilities could either adopt  the bundle completely (100%) in the first year of launch, or phase-in (25%) over  four years. Differences in practice patterns and patient outcomes were hypothesized  to occur in facilities that phased-in 25% compared to those that did not. METHODS:  Data are from STEPPS, a study of 51 small dialysis organization facilities designed  to describe trends in dialytic treatment before and after bundle implementation.  Baseline was defined as October-December 2010; follow-up as January-December 2011.  Facility- and patient-level data were collected at enrollment and regularly  thereafter. Cox proportiol hazards and linear multi-level models were used to  estimate the effect of opting-in 25% (vs. 100%) on practice patterns and clinical  outcomes. RESULTS: 12 facilities (patient n = 346) opted-in 25% and 37 facilities  (patient n = 1296) opted-in 100% to the dialysis bundle. At baseline, patients at  25% facilities were primarily covered by Medicare, were more likely to be black, and  were receiving higher monthly epoetin alfa (EPO) doses. Throughout 2011, patients in  100% facilities received lower monthly EPO doses, and had lower mean hemoglobin  concentrations; hospitalization and mortality rates were numerically lower in 25%  facilities but not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: The economic pressure for  dialysis providers to work within an expanded composite rate bundle whilst  maintaining patient care may be a driver of practice indicator outcomes.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted  using an academic health center enterprise-wide electronic health record (EHR)  system to identify 13,185 adult patients (>18 years) with T2DM from January 2008 to  June 2013 and received a prescription for MF in combition with a sulfonylurea (SU;  n = 9419), thiazolidinedione (TZD; n = 1846), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor  (DPP-4i; n = 1487), or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1a; n = 433).  Multivariate Cox models with propensity alysis were used to compare cohorts, with  MF+SU serving as the comparator group. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) age was 60.6 ± 12.6  years, with 54.6% male and 75.8% Caucasians. The median follow-up was 4 years. There  were 1077 deaths, 1733 CAD events, and 528 CHF events in 55,100 person-years of  follow-up. A higher risk of CHF was observed with MF+DPP-4i use (hazard ratio [HR]  1.104; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.17; P = 0.001). A trend towards improved  overall survival for users of MF+TZD (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74-1.0; P = 0.05) and  MF+GLP-1a (HR 0.569; 95% CI 0.30-1.07; P = 0.08) was observed.

Little has been  published on the outcome and epidemiology of S. aureus endocarditis (SAE) in the  twenty-first century. Our aim was to evaluate the short-term and long-term outcome  of SAE in Stockholm, Sweden, and assess its incidence over time. Patients treated  for SAE from January 2004 through December 2013 were retrospectively identified at  the Karolinska University Hospital. Clinical data were obtained from medical records  and the diagnosis was verified according to the modified Duke criteria. Of 245 SAE  cases, 152 (62%) were left-sided and 120 (49%) occurred in intravenous drug users.  The calculated incidence in Stockholm County was 1.56/100 000 person-years,  increasing from 1.28 in 2004-08 to 1.82/100 000 person-years in 2009-13 (p 0.002).

Age (OR 1.06 per year) and female sex (OR 3.0) were independently  associated with in-hospital mortality in multivariate alysis. Involvement of the  central nervous system (CNS) was observed in 30 (12%) patients, and valvular surgery  was performed during hospitalization in 37 (15%). In left-sided endocarditis the  strongest predictors for surgery were severe valvular insufficiency (OR 8.9), lower  age (OR 1.07 per year) and no intravenous drug use (OR 10.7), and for CNS  involvement lower age (OR 1.04 per year). In conclusion we noted low mortality, low  CNS complication rate, and low valvular surgery frequency associated with SAE in our  setting. The incidence was high and increased over time.

However, in-hospital recording  of confounders is limited, and incorporating linked healthcare claims data available  for a subset of the cohort may improve confounding control. We investigated methods  capable of adjusting for confounders measured in a subset, including complete case  alysis, multiple imputation of missing data, and propensity score (PS)  calibration. METHODS: Methods were implemented in an example study of adults in  Premier undergoing percutaneous corory intervention (PCI) in 2004-2008 and exposed  to either bivalirudin or heparin. In a subset of patients enrolled in UnitedHealth  for at least 90xa0days before hospitalization, additiol confounders were assessed  from healthcare claims, including comorbidities, prior medication use, and service  use intensity. Diagnostics for each method were evaluated, and methods were compared  with respect to the estimates and confidence intervals of treatment effects on  repeat PCI, bleeding, and in-hospital death. RESULTS: Of 210,268 patients in the  hospital-based cohort, 3240 (1.5xa0%) had linked healthcare claims. This subset was  younger and healthier than the overall study population. The linked subset was too  small for complete case evaluation of two of the three outcomes of interest.  Multiple imputation and PS calibration did not meaningfully impact treatment effect  estimates and associated confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite more than 98xa0%  missingness on 24 variables, PS calibration and multiple imputation incorporated  confounders from healthcare claims without major increases in estimate uncertainty.  Additiol research is needed to determine the relative bias of these methods.FAU - Franklin, Jessica MAU - Franklin JMAD - Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine,  Brigham and Women', NULL, 210268);

METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with  de Quervain tendinopathy treated with corticosteroid injections (lidocaine plus  triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone) were prospectively enrolled. Patients with  inflammatory arthritis, carpometacarpal osteoarthritis, or a previous distal radius  fracture affecting the symptomatic wrist were excluded. Demographic data and  information on existing comorbidities were recorded. Patients were seen in clinic at  6 weeks after injection and contacted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following injection  to determine symptom recurrence and further intervention. Medical records were also  reviewed for this purpose. Kaplan-Meier survival alysis and Cox regression  modeling were used to estimate recurrence rates and identify predictors of symptom  recurrence and repeat intervention. RESULTS: Fifty wrists in 50 patients (average  age, 49 y) were included. One patient was lost to follow-up. Eighty-two percent of  patients had resolved symptoms 6 weeks after a steroid injection. Twenty-four  patients had a recurrence of symptoms at a median of 84 days after the injection.  Eleven patients underwent additiol intervention (7 surgical releases and 4 repeat  injections) at a median of 129 days (range, 42-365) after the injection. Estimated  freedom from symptom recurrence was 52% at 6 and 12 months. Estimated freedom from  repeat intervention was 81% at 6 months and 77% at 12 months. Two of 3 patients with  a history of trigger finger required subsequent de Quervain surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We  demonstrated that a single cortisone injection was effective in alleviating symptoms  of de Quervain tendinopathy in 82% of patients and that over half remained  symptom-free for at least 12 months. All patients with recurring symptoms developed  them within the first 6 months. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic IV.', NULL, 50);

We sought to determine the  prevalence and gender-based differences of excess dosing of anticoagulants including  glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, bivalirudin, and unfractioted heparin in young  patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent PCI and to examine its  association with bleeding. Of 2,076 patients enrolled in the Variation in Recovery:  Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients study who  underwent PCI, we abstracted doses of unfractioted heparin, bivalirudin, and  glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors administered during PCI from the medical records.  At least 47.2% received at least 1 excess dose of an anticoagulant, which did not  differ by gender. We used logistic regression to determine the predictors of excess  dosing and the association of excess dosing with bleeding. In multivariable  alysis, only lower body weight and younger age were significant predictors of  excess dosing. Bleeding was higher in young women who received excess dosing versus  those who did not (9.3% vs 6.0%, p = 0.03) but was comparable among men (5.2% vs  5.9%, p = 0.69) in univariate alysis. In multivariable alysis, there was a trend  to an association between excess dosing and bleeding (odds ratio 1.33, 95%  confidence interval 0.92 to 1.91) although not statistically significant. In  conclusion, approximately half of the patients received excess dosing of  anticoagulant drugs during PCI, which did not vary based on gender.

Several prophylactic  regimens have been developed including oral administration of nobsorbable  antifungals and intravenous infusions. No reports to date have employed a topical  regimen. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of topical nystatin cream in  preventing catheter-associated Candida sepsis. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive  design was used to determine the incidence of Candida sepsis in extremely low-birth  weight (ELBW, <1000 g at birth) infants who were treated with topical nystatin cream  for Candida bloodstream infection prophylaxis between January 1, 2000, and December  31, 2010. The electronic medical records of study infants were reviewed to establish  the incidence of Candida sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 464 ELBW infants were admitted  to the NICU during the study period. Three infants (0.65%) developed Candida sepsis.  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These data demonstrate that a topical nystatin cream  protocol is associated with a very low rate of Candida sepsis in ELBW infants with  central catheters. The use of this protocol may contribute to a decrease in the  morbidity and mortality rate associated with catheter-associated Candida infections  in ELBW infants. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Before generalizations can be made as to  the safety and efficacy of this protocol as compared to enteral and parenteral  prophylactic treatments and in other institutions, large multicenter randomized  controlled trials are required.FAU - Bodin, Mary BethAU - Bodin MBAD - University of Alabama School of Nursing, Birmingham, and NICU, DCH Regiol Medical  Center, Tuscaloosa, Alabama (Dr Bodin); NICU, DCH Regiol Medical Center,  Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and University of Alabama Departments of Pediatrics and  Obstetrics, Tuscaloosa (Dr Godoy); and Department of Pediatrics, Division of  Neotology, University of Alabama at Birmingham (Dr Philips).FAU - Godoy, GuillermoAU - Godoy G', NULL, 0);
